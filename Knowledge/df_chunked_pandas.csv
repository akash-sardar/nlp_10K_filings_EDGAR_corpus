Organization and Operation
The Company. The Company was organized under the laws of the State of Vermont in 1982 and became a registered bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, in October 1983 when it acquired all of the voting shares of the Bank, headquartered in Derby, Vermont. The Bank is the only subsidiary of the Company and principally all of the Company’s business operations are presently conducted through it. Therefore, the following narrative and the other information about the Company contained in this report are based primarily on the Bank’s operations.
The Bank; Banking Services. Community National Bank was organized in 1851 as the Peoples Bank, and was subsequently reorganized as the National Bank of Derby Line in 1865. In 1975, after 110 continuous years of operation as the National Bank of Derby Line, the Bank acquired the Island Pond National Bank and changed its name to “Community National Bank.” On December 31, 2007, the Company completed its acquisition of LyndonBank, a Vermont bank headquartered in Lyndonville, Vermont, in a cash merger transaction. As a result of the merger, the Company expanded its existing branch network in Caledonia and Orleans Counties and extended it into Lamoille and Franklin Counties. In addition to its main office in Derby, the Company currently maintains eleven branch offices in northeastern and central Vermont and loan production offices in Chittenden County, in northwestern Vermont, and Grafton County, in western New Hampshire.",section_1,1e4ed720-ff62-446f-93c1-4c17f996bfaf

The opportunities for growth continue to be primarily in the Central Vermont and Chittenden County markets where economic activity is more robust than in the Company’s Orleans and Caledonia County markets, and where the Company is increasing its presence and market share. The Company is also focusing on expanding its presence in the neighboring state of New Hampshire through the opening of its loan production office in Lebanon, New Hampshire in 2019.
The Company, through the Bank, provides a broad range of loan and deposit services to the residents, businesses, nonprofit organizations and municipalities in its northern and central Vermont markets. Significant services offered by the Company include:
·
Business Banking - The Company offers a range of credit products for a variety of general business purposes, including financing for commercial business properties, equipment, inventories and accounts receivable, as well as letters of credit.

Related Trust Company. In 2002, the Bank transferred its trust operations to a newly formed Vermont-chartered non-depository trust and investment management company, CFSG, based in Newport, Vermont. The Bank’s ownership interest in CFSG is held indirectly, through CFS Partners, a Vermont limited liability company, which owns 100% of the limited liability company equity interests of CFSG. Immediately following transfer of its trust operations to CFSG, the Bank sold a two-thirds interest in CFS Partners, equally to the National Bank of Middlebury, headquartered in Middlebury, Vermont and Guaranty Bancorp Inc., the bank holding company parent of Woodsville Guaranty Savings Bank, headquartered in Woodsville, New Hampshire. CFSG offers fiduciary services throughout the market areas of the three owner financial institutions and leases space from them in some of their branch offices, including at the Bank’s facilities in Barre and Lyndonville, Vermont.
Statutory Business Trust. In 2007, the Company formed CMTV Statutory Trust I (the Trust), a Delaware statutory business trust, for the purpose of issuing $12.5 million of trust preferred securities and lending the proceeds to the Company. This funding provided a portion of the cash consideration paid by the Company in the acquisition of LyndonBank and provided additional regulatory capital. The Trust is a variable interest entity for which the Company is not the primary beneficiary, within the meaning of applicable accounting standards. Accordingly, the Trust is not consolidated with the Company for financial reporting purposes.

Competition
All of the Bank’s full-service banking offices are located in northern and central Vermont. The Bank’s main office is located in Derby, in Orleans County. In addition to its main office, the Bank has four other banking offices in Orleans County, one office in Essex County, two offices in Caledonia County, two offices in Washington County and one office each in Franklin and Lamoille Counties. The Bank also maintains loan production offices in Chittenden County, Vermont and Grafton County, New Hampshire.

The Bank competes in all aspects of its business with other banks and credit unions in northern and central Vermont, including three of the largest banks operating in the state, which maintain branch offices throughout the Bank’s service area. The Bank also competes with bank and non-bank lenders in Chittenden County, Vermont and Grafton County, New Hampshire where it maintains loan production offices. Changes in the regulatory framework of the financial services industry during the past decade have broadened the competition for commercial bank products, such as deposits and loans, to include not only traditional rivals such as banks, savings banks and credit unions, but also many non-traditional rivals such as insurance companies, brokerage firms, mutual funds and consumer and commercial finance and leasing companies. In addition, many out-of-market nationwide banks, nonbank lenders and other financial service firms operate in the Company’s market areas through mass marketing solicitations by mail, radio, television, the internet and email. At the same time, technological changes have facilitated remote delivery of financial services by bank and nonbank competitors outside the context of a traditional branch bank network, thereby intensifying competition from out-of-market firms. This trend may accelerate, as customers’ use of and reliance on technology for remote delivery of financial services has accelerated as a result of the limitations imposed on in-person banking during the COVID-19 pandemic.",section_1,4e94ce64-ba68-4b36-a4e4-3ac975031737

Competition from the tax-exempt credit union industry has also intensified in recent years. A number of the Bank’s credit union competitors, including the largest state-chartered Vermont credit union, have converted from an employment based common bond to a community common bond, thereby significantly increasing their fields of membership in the Bank’s market areas. Because federal law subsidizes credit unions by giving them a general exemption from federal income taxes, they have a significant pricing advantage over commercial banks for their deposit and loan products. This pricing advantage, coupled with the relaxing of membership criteria and regulatory restrictions on product offerings, has resulted in increased competition for the Bank from this tax exempt sector of the financial services industry.
In order to compete with other bank and non-bank service providers, the Company stresses the community orientation of its banking operations and relies to a large extent upon personal relationships established by its officers, directors and employees with their customers and on their strong ties to the local community. In addition, management’s knowledge of the local community assists it in tailoring the Company’s products and services to meet the needs of its customer base. Although competition is strong throughout the Company’s market area, management believes that the Company can continue to compete effectively, in view of its local market knowledge and community ties and its understanding of customer needs.

Employees
As of December 31, 2020, the Company did not have any employees at the holding company level. However, as of such date, the Bank employed 126 full-time employees and 10 part-time employees. The Bank provides our full-time and part-time employees with a comprehensive employee benefit package, including medical benefits, life insurance and a 401K retirement savings plan. Additionally, full-time employees also have disability insurance as part of their benefit package. The Bank is not a party to any collective bargaining agreement and management of the Bank considers its employee relations to be good.
Regulation and Supervision
The following discussion describes elements of an extensive regulatory framework applicable to bank holding companies and banks, to which the Company and the Bank are subject. Regulation of banks and bank holding companies is intended primarily for the protection of depositors and the Deposit Insurance Fund of the FDIC, rather than for the protection of shareholders and creditors.
The Company’s earnings are affected by general economic conditions, management policies, changes in federal and state laws and regulations and actions of various regulatory authorities, including those referred to below. Banking is a highly regulated business and proposals to change the laws and regulations to which the Company and the Bank are subject are frequently introduced at both the federal and state levels. The likelihood and timing of any such changes and the impact such changes may have on the Company and the Bank is impossible to predict with any certainty.

Bank Holding Company Act. As a registered bank holding company, the Company is subject to on-going regulation, supervision and examination by the FRB, under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the Act). A bank holding company for example, must generally obtain the prior approval of the FRB before it acquires all or substantially all of the assets of any bank, or acquires ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares of a bank. FRB approval is also generally required before a bank holding company may acquire more than 5% of any outstanding class of voting securities of a company other than a bank or a more than 5% interest in its property. also generally required before a bank holding company may acquire more than 5% of any outstanding class of voting securities of a company other than a bank or a more than 5% interest in its property.",section_1,dc472f28-7188-4c9c-81d9-1004f597e64e

Some of the activities that the FRB has determined to be closely related to banking are: (1) making and servicing loans that could be made by mortgage, finance, credit card or factoring companies; (2) performing the functions of a trust company; (3) certain leasing of real or personal property; (4) providing certain financial, banking or economic data processing services; (5) except as otherwise prohibited by law, acting as an insurance agent or broker with respect to insurance that is directly related to the extension of credit or the provision of other financial services or, under certain circumstances, with respect to insurance that is sold in certain small communities in which the bank holding company system maintains banking offices; (6) acting as an underwriter for credit life insurance and credit health and accident insurance directly related to extensions of credit by the holding company system; (7) providing certain kinds of management consulting advice to unaffiliated banks and non-bank depository institutions; (8) performing real estate appraisals; (9) issuing and selling money order and similar instruments and travelers checks and selling U.S. Savings Bonds; (10) providing certain securities brokerage and related services for the account of bank customers; (11) underwriting and dealing in certain government obligations and other obligations such as bankers’ acceptances and certificates of deposit; (12) providing consumer financial counseling; (13) providing tax planning and preparation services; (14) providing check guarantee services to merchants; (15) operating a collection agency; and (16) operating a credit bureau.

Trust and investment management activities conducted through a non-depository trust company such as the Company’s affiliate, CFSG, are also considered by the FRB to be permissible nonbanking activities that are closely related to banking.
Except for CFSG’s trust and investment management operations, the Company does not presently engage, directly or indirectly through any affiliate, in any other permissible non-banking activities.
A bank holding company must obtain prior FRB approval in order to purchase or redeem its own stock if the gross consideration to be paid, when added to the net consideration paid by the company for all purchases or redemptions by the company of its equity securities within the preceding 12 months, will equal 10% or more of the company’s consolidated net worth.

The Company, the Bank, CFS Partners and CFSG are all considered “affiliates” of each other for the purposes of Section 18(j) of the FDIA, as amended, and Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, as amended. In particular, section 23A limits loans or other extensions of credit to, asset purchases with and investments in affiliates of the Bank to 10% of the Bank’s capital and surplus. In addition, such loans and extensions of credit and certain other transactions must be collateralized in specified amounts. Section 23B requires, among other things, that certain transactions between the Bank and its affiliates must be on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the Bank, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with or involving non-affiliated persons. Further, the Company is prohibited from engaging in certain tie-in arrangements in connection with any extension of credit or lease or sale of any property or the furnishing of services.
Capital Adequacy Requirements. Revised regulatory capital rules were adopted in July 2013 by the federal banking regulators to implement the Basel III capital standards and certain capital requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act. The effect of the rules was to impose higher minimum capital requirements for bank holding companies and banks. The rules apply to all national and state banks and savings associations regardless of size and bank holding companies and savings and loan holding companies with $500 million or more in total consolidated assets. More stringent requirements apply to certain larger banking organizations. The requirements in the rule were fully phased in on January 1, 2019, for the Company and the Bank.",section_1,a4d62a46-93d0-4f5d-8da3-b5c092f2999c

The Basel III capital rules include certain new and higher risk-based capital and leverage requirements than those previously in place. Specifically, the following minimum capital requirements now apply to the Company and the Bank:
●
a new common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 4.5%;
●
a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6% (increased from the former 4% requirement);
●
a total risk-based capital ratio of 8% (unchanged from the former requirement); and
●
a leverage ratio of 4% (also unchanged from the former requirement).
Under the rules, Tier 1 capital is redefined to include two components: Common Equity Tier 1 capital and additional Tier 1 capital. The new and highest form of capital, Common Equity Tier 1 capital, consists solely of common stock (plus related surplus), retained earnings, accumulated other comprehensive income, and limited amounts of minority interests that are in the form of common stock. Additional Tier 1 capital includes other perpetual instruments historically included in Tier 1 capital, such as noncumulative perpetual preferred stock. Tier 2 capital consists of instruments that currently qualify in Tier 2 capital plus instruments that the rule has disqualified from Tier 1 capital treatment. Cumulative perpetual preferred stock, formerly includable in Tier 1 capital, is now included only in Tier 2 capital. Although AOCI is presumptively included in Common Equity Tier 1 capital, the rule provided a one-time opportunity at the end of the first quarter of 2015 for covered banking organizations to opt out of much of this treatment of AOCI. The Company and Bank made this opt-out election and, as a result, have retained the pre-existing regulatory capital treatment for AOCI.",section_1,c570480e-c1d5-49dd-932c-4eee76e99c97

In addition, in order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions or discretionary bonus payments to executives, a covered banking organization must maintain a “capital conservation buffer” on top of its minimum risk-based capital requirements. This buffer must consist solely of Tier 1 Common Equity, but the buffer applies to all three measurements (Common Equity Tier 1, Tier 1 capital and total capital). The capital conservation buffer was phased in incrementally over time and became fully effective on January 1, 2019, consisting of an additional amount of common equity equal to 2.5% of risk-weighted assets. The Company and the Bank satisfied this fully-phased in capital conservation buffer. Failure to maintain the required buffer would result in limitations on permissible shareholder distributions and discretionary bonus payments.
In general, the rules have had the effect of increasing capital requirements by increasing the risk weights on certain assets, including high volatility commercial real estate, certain loans past due 90 days or more or in nonaccrual status, mortgage servicing rights not includable in Common Equity Tier 1 capital, equity exposures, and claims on securities firms, that are used in the denominator of the three risk-based capital ratios.
The Company’s capital ratios exceeded all applicable regulatory requirements at December 31, 2020. (See Note 23 to the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information about the Company’s and the Bank’s regulatory capital ratios.)
The Basel III capital standards also revised the FDIC’s “prompt corrective action” requirements (see “Prompt Corrective Action” below).",section_1,5b7b23b4-dd1c-4bd3-9c2f-cc05fa0acde2

The Basel III capital standards also revised the FDIC’s “prompt corrective action” requirements (see “Prompt Corrective Action” below).
Under the 2018 Regulatory Relief Act, these capital requirements have been simplified for qualifying community banks and bank holding companies. In September 2019, the OCC and the other federal bank regulators approved a final joint rule that permits a qualifying community banking organization to opt in to a simplified regulatory capital framework. A qualifying institution that elects to utilize the simplified framework must maintain a CBLR in excess of 9%, and will thereby be deemed to have satisfied the generally applicable risk-based and other leverage capital requirements and (if applicable) the FDIC’s prompt corrective action framework. In order to utilize the CBLR framework, in addition to maintaining a CBLR of over 9%, a community banking organization must have less than $10 billion in total consolidated assets and must meet certain other criteria such as limitations on the amount of off-balance sheet exposures and on trading assets and liabilities. The CBLR is calculated by dividing tangible equity capital by average total consolidated assets. Pursuant to the CARES Act, the federal banking agencies adopted an interim rule temporarily lowering the CBLR benchmark to in excess of 8%, rather than 9%, with a phased increase of the CBLR back to the 9% level by the end of 2021. The Company and Bank continued to qualify to utilize the CBLR framework as of December 31, 2020, however, as noted in Note 23 to the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements, as of December 31, 2020, they had not elected to do so.",section_1,e0b581fe-c60e-4c8f-9eb3-919a7220f0d9

SOX and the SEC’s implementing regulations include provisions addressing, among other matters, the duties, functions and qualifications of audit committees for all public companies; certification of financial statements by the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer; the forfeiture of bonuses or other incentive-based compensation and profits from the sale of an issuer’s securities by directors and senior officers in the twelve month period following initial publication of any financial statements that later require restatement; disclosure of off-balance sheet transactions; a prohibition on personal loans to directors and officers, except (in the case of banking companies) loans in the normal course of business; expedited filing requirements for reports of beneficial ownership of company stock by insiders; disclosure of a code of ethics for senior officers, and of any change or waiver of such code; the formation of a public accounting oversight board; auditor independence; disclosure of fees paid to the company’s auditors for non-audit services and limitations on the provision of such services; attestation requirements for company management and external auditors, relating to internal controls and procedures; and various increased criminal penalties for violations of federal securities laws.",section_1,8b86d14b-66e2-40ce-8bf5-1481f5707e69

Management’s report on internal control over financial reporting for 2020 is contained in Part II, Item 9A of this Report. Effective December 31, 2020, as a non-accelerated filer for SEC reporting purposes, the Company is no longer required to obtain from its external auditors an attestation on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting and the operating effectiveness of these controls under Section 404(b) of SOX.

SEC Reporting and Disclosure Requirements. Under current SEC reporting and disclosure rules, as amended in 2018, and 2020, the Company is once again considered to be a non-accelerated filer and a smaller reporting company. As noted above, due to this change in filing status, the Company is no longer subject to the requirements in SOX section 404(b) to obtain an external auditor attestation of management’s assessment of the Company’s internal controls and their effectiveness.

Dividends. The Company derives funds for payment of dividends to its shareholders primarily from dividends received from its subsidiary, Community National Bank. Under the National Bank Act, prior approval from the OCC is required if the total of all dividends declared by a national bank in any calendar year will exceed the sum of such bank’s net profits for that last year and its retained net profits for the preceding two calendar years, less any required transfers to surplus. Federal law also prohibits national banks from paying dividends greater than the bank’s undivided profits after deducting statutory bad debt in excess of the bank’s ALL.
The Company and the Bank are also subject to various general regulatory policies and requirements relating to the payment of dividends, including requirements to maintain adequate capital above regulatory minimums. The appropriate federal or state banking agency is authorized to determine under certain circumstances relating to the financial condition of a bank or bank holding company that the payment of dividends would be an unsafe or unsound practice and to prohibit such payment. In addition, under the Basel III capital requirements, failure to maintain the required capital conservation buffer would result in additional limitations on permissible shareholder distributions.",section_1,32b663b5-bec1-49a5-b5c1-8ed1a147cf40

The FRB has issued supervisory guidance on the payment of dividends and redemption and repurchases of stock by bank holding companies reflecting the expectation that a bank holding company will inform and consult with FRB supervisory staff in advance of declaring and paying any dividend that could raise safety and soundness concerns. Examples of actions that might raise such concerns include declaration of a dividend exceeding current period earnings; redeeming or repurchasing regulatory capital instruments when the bank holding company is experiencing financial weaknesses; or redeeming or repurchasing common stock or perpetual preferred stock that would result in a net reduction in the amount of such equity instruments outstanding compared with the beginning of the quarter in which the redemption or repurchase occurred. The guidance provides that a bank holding company should eliminate, defer or severely limit dividends if net income for the past four quarters is not sufficient to fully fund dividends; the prospective rate of earnings retention is not consistent with the holding company’s capital needs and overall current and prospective financial condition; or the holding company will not meet, or is in danger of not meeting, its minimum regulatory capital ratios.",section_1,d4882c3e-81ec-430d-8079-75dc96ab6a2f

The CARES Act and Other Initiatives Related to COVID-19. On March 27, 2020, the CARES Act was signed into law, which provided approximately $2.2 trillion in direct economic relief in response to the public health and economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Many of the CARES Act’s programs are, and remain, dependent upon the direct involvement of financial institutions like the Bank. These programs have been implemented through rules and guidance adopted by federal departments and agencies, including the U.S. Department of Treasury, the FRB and other federal bank regulatory authorities. These rules and other subsequent regulatory initiatives have provided guidance on the implementation, eligibility requirements and terms of the various CARES Act programs, as well as industry-specific recovery procedures for COVID-19. It is possible that Congress will enact additional COVID-19 response legislation, including amendments to the CARES Act or new bills comparable in scope to the CARES Act.

Paycheck Protection Program. The CARES Act amended the SBA’s loan programs to create the PPP, a guaranteed, unsecured loan program, to fund operational costs of eligible businesses, organizations and self-employed persons impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. These loans, which bear a mandated fixed annual interest rate of one percent, are eligible to be forgiven if certain conditions are satisfied and are fully guaranteed by the SBA. Additionally, no collateral or personal guarantees are required. The PPP commenced on April 3, 2020 and was available to qualified borrowers through August 8, 2020. On December 27, 2020, the President signed into law omnibus federal spending and economic stimulus legislation titled the “Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021” (the “CAA”) that included the Economic Aid to Hard-Hit Small Businesses, Nonprofits, and Venues Act (the “HHSB Act”). Among other things, the HHSB Act renewed the PPP, allocating $284.45 billion for both new first time PPP loans under the existing PPP and the expansion of existing PPP loans for certain qualified, existing PPP borrowers. The Bank has participated in both rounds of PPP lending.",section_1,c0fcce30-014f-4513-9836-03f71333d1d0

Troubled Debt Restructurings and Loan Modifications for Affected Borrowers. The CARES Act, as extended by the CAA, permits banks to suspend requirements under GAAP for loan modifications to borrowers affected by COVID-19 that may otherwise be required to be characterized as TDRs and to suspend any related determination if (i) the borrower was not more than 30 days past due as of December 31, 2019, (ii) the modifications are related to COVID-19, and (iii) the modification occurs between March 1, 2020 and the earlier of 60 days after the date of termination of the national emergency or January 1, 2022. During 2020, the federal bank regulatory authorities also issued guidance to encourage banks to make loan modifications for borrowers affected by COVID-19. The Bank has followed this guidance in providing relief to borrowers affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Effect on Regulatory Capital. On September 29, 2020, the federal bank regulatory agencies issued a final rule that neutralizes the regulatory capital and liquidity coverage ratio effects of participating in certain COVID-19 liquidity facilities due to the fact there is no credit or market risk associated with exposures pledged to such facilities. As a result, the final rule supports the flow of credit to households and businesses affected by COVID-19.",section_1,cee49327-99e8-4d1c-97e9-37490eafa586

Dodd-Frank Act. Although the 2008 financial crisis has now passed, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the Dodd-Frank Act) will continue to affect the Company’s operations as it represents a comprehensive revision and restructuring of many aspects of the financial services industry. Many of the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act are designed to reduce systemic risk from large, complex “systemically significant” financial institutions, and thus do not apply to a smaller banking organization such as the Company. Nevertheless, certain of its provisions do directly apply to the Company and others indirectly impact its operations, as the Dodd-Frank Act continues to reshape the financial services environment. Among other things, the Act:
·
Established a new independent agency, the CFPB, with centralized responsibility for implementing and (with respect to large organizations) enforcing and examining compliance with federal consumer financial laws. Although the CFPB does not have enforcement or examination authority over smaller banking organizations such as the Company, many of its regulatory standards and mandates apply to them, with enforcement authority vested in other regulatory agencies such as (with respect to the Bank) the OCC;
·
Applies the same leverage and risk-based capital requirements that apply to insured depository institutions to most bank holding companies, savings and loan holding companies and systemically important non-bank financial companies on a consolidated basis. These changes prohibit the use of additional trust preferred securities as Tier 1 capital, but the Company’s existing trust preferred securities are grandfathered;

·
Requires debit card interchange transaction fees charged by large financial institutions to be reasonable and proportional to the cost incurred by the issuer for the transaction. The FRB adopted regulations in 2011 establishing such fee standards, eliminating exclusivity arrangements between issuers and networks for debit card transactions and limiting restrictions on merchant discounting for use of certain payment forms and minimum or maximum amount thresholds as a condition for acceptance of credit cards. Although smaller institutions such as the Company are not subject to the interchange fee restrictions, it is possible that, over time, competitive pricing pressures in the marketplace may operate to make the restrictions applicable to them by default;
·
Requires public companies to periodically seek “say on executive pay” and “say on frequency” votes of shareholders, and in some circumstances, a “say on golden parachute” vote of shareholders. These vote requirements first became applicable for the Company’s 2013 annual meeting of shareholders, with the next “say on pay” vote scheduled to take place at the 2022 Annual Meeting of shareholders;
·
Allowed depository institutions to pay interest on demand deposits effective July 21, 2011;
·
Established by statute the FRB’s “source of strength” doctrine mandating holding company financial support of subsidiary insured depository institutions;
·
Eliminated state restrictions on de novo interstate branching;
·
Established new requirements related to residential mortgage lending, including prohibitions against payment of steering incentives and provisions relating to underwriting standards, disclosures, appraisals and escrows. Many of these provisions have been implemented through CFPB rulemakings;

Permanently increased the FDIC’s standard maximum deposit insurance amount to $250,000, changed the FDIC insurance assessment base to assets rather than deposits and increased the reserve ratio for the DIF to ensure the future strength of the fund.
OCC Supervision. As a national banking association, the Bank is subject to the provisions of the National Bank Act and federal and state statutes and rules and regulations applicable to national banks. The primary supervisory authority for the Bank is the OCC. The Bank is subject to periodic examination by the OCC and must file periodic reports with the OCC containing a complete statement of its financial condition and results of operations. The OCC’s examinations are designed for the protection of the Bank’s depositors and not the Company’s shareholders.",section_1,972deb68-46b2-429e-95ac-b1285b6ef0a9

In 2011, the CFPB, created by the Dodd-Frank Act, took over responsibility for implementing the principal federal consumer protection laws, such as the Truth in Lending Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act and the Truth in Saving Act, among others. However, financial institutions that have assets of $10 billion or less, such as our Bank subsidiary, will continue to be supervised and examined in this area by their primary federal regulators (in the case of our Bank subsidiary, the OCC). The Dodd-Frank Act also gives the CFPB expanded data collecting powers for fair lending purposes for both small business and mortgage loans, as well as expanded authority to prevent unfair, deceptive and abusive practices.",section_1,42c81014-e1d4-494b-aa71-f695231533ff

Prompt Corrective Action. The Bank is subject to regulatory capital requirements established under FDICIA. Among other things, FDICIA identifies five capital categories for insured depository institutions (well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized) and requires the respective U.S. federal bank regulatory agencies to implement systems for “prompt corrective action” for insured depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements within such categories. FDICIA imposes progressively more restrictive constraints on operations, management and capital distributions, depending on the category in which an institution is classified. Failure to meet the capital guidelines could also subject a banking institution to capital raising requirements. An “undercapitalized” bank must develop a capital restoration plan and its parent holding company must guarantee that bank’s compliance with the plan. The liability of the parent holding company under any such guarantee is limited to the lessor of 5% of the bank’s assets at the time it became undercapitalized or the amount needed to comply with the plan. Furthermore, in the event of the bankruptcy of the parent holding company, such guarantee would take priority over the parent’s general unsecured creditors. In addition, FDICIA requires the various regulatory agencies to prescribe certain non-capital standards for safety and soundness related generally to operations and management, asset quality and executive compensation and permits regulatory action against a financial institution that does not meet such standards.",section_1,f0cac886-ca9a-47bc-bd13-b173948eb3a8
718413,718413_2020.htm,2020,"and soundness related generally to operations and management, asset quality and executive compensation and permits regulatory action against a financial institution that does not meet such standards.
The federal bank regulatory agencies, including the OCC, have adopted substantially similar regulations that define the five capital categories identified by FDICIA. These regulations establish various degrees of corrective action to be taken when an FDIC-insured depository institution is considered undercapitalized. Effective January 1, 2015, the FDIC’s Prompt Corrective Action regulations were revised in accordance with the Basel III capital standards. The enhanced requirements (i) introduce a Common Equity Tier 1 ratio requirement at each capital category (other than critically undercapitalized), and set the required Common Equity Tier 1 ratio at 6.5% for well-capitalized status; (ii) increase the minimum Tier 1 capital ratio requirement for each category (other than critically undercapitalized), and set the minimum Tier 1 capital ratio for well-capitalized status at 8.0% (as compared to 6.0% under the prior rule); and (iii) eliminate the provision that permitted a bank with a composite supervisory rating of 1 to have a 3% leverage ratio and still be considered adequately capitalized. The Basel III capital standards do not change the total risk-based capital requirement for any prompt corrective action category.
As of December 31, 2020, the Bank was considered “well capitalized” under FDICIA’s Prompt Corrective Action capital requirements. (See Note 23 to the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information about the Bank’s regulatory capital ratios.)",section_1,1de9a866-31ba-4b37-850d-96b9d8094bb1

Safety and Soundness Regulations. Pursuant to the FDIA, the federal bank regulatory agencies have adopted safety and soundness guidelines establishing general standards relating to internal controls, information systems, internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate risk exposure, asset growth, asset quality, earnings, compensation, fees and benefits. In general, the guidelines require, among other things, appropriate systems and practices to identify, monitor, and manage the risks and exposures specified in the guidelines. The guidelines prohibit excessive compensation as an unsafe and unsound practice and describe compensation as excessive when the amounts paid are unreasonable or disproportionate to the services performed by an executive officer, employee, director or principal shareholder. In addition, the safety and soundness regulations include enforcement provisions, including authority for the bank regulatory agencies to require a financial institution in some circumstances to create and implement a compliance plan.",section_1,2cabe7ea-f548-4726-a484-cdb66a8fa7bf

Deposit Insurance. The deposits of the Bank are insured by the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) of the FDIC up to the limits set forth under applicable law and are subject to the deposit insurance premium assessments of the DIF. The FDIC imposes a risk-based deposit premium assessments system, which was amended pursuant to the Federal Deposit Insurance Reform Act of 2005 and further amended by the Dodd-Frank Act. Under this system, as amended, the assessment rates for an insured depository institution vary according to the level of risk incurred in its activities. To arrive at an assessment rate for a banking institution, the FDIC places it in one of four risk categories determined by reference to its capital levels and supervisory ratings. In addition, in the case of those institutions in the lowest risk category, the FDIC further determines its assessment rate based on certain specified financial ratios or, if applicable, its long-term debt ratings. The assessment rate schedule can change from time to time, at the discretion of the FDIC, subject to certain limits. In addition, previously all FDIC insured depository institutions were required to pay a pro rata portion of the interest due on the obligations issued by the FICO to fund the closing and disposal of failed thrift institutions by the Resolution Trust Corporation. The FDIC discontinued collection of these payments in March 2019.",section_1,bf0c8702-f06a-45fa-875d-c65db61c4b48

The Dodd-Frank Act changed the assessment formula for determining deposit insurance premiums and modified certain insurance coverage provisions of the FDIA. The FDIC’s implementing rules, which redefined the base for FDIC insurance assessments from the amount of insured deposits to average consolidated total assets less average tangible equity, became effective April 1, 2011. The Bank’s total FDIC insurance assessment for 2020 was $300,643.

Brokered Deposits. Under FDICIA, an FDIC-insured bank is prohibited from accepting brokered deposits without prior approval of the FDIC unless it is well capitalized under the FDICIA’s prompt corrective actions guidelines. The Company participates in the CDARS of the Promontory Interfinancial Network, which uses a deposit-matching engine to match CDARS deposits in other participating banks, dollar-for-dollar. This product, also known as reciprocal deposits, is designed to provide deposit insurance in excess of FDIC limits and thereby enhance customer attraction and retention, build deposits and improve net interest margins. Until recently reciprocal deposits were considered a form of brokered deposits, which are treated less favorably than other deposits for certain purposes; however, a provision of the 2018 Regulatory Relief Act provides that reciprocal deposits held by a well-capitalized and well managed bank are no longer classified as brokered deposits. CDARS also permits the “one-way” purchase of deposits, which the Company utilizes from time to time for liquidity management purposes. CDARS one-way deposits are considered brokered deposits for certain purposes under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and FDIC regulations. As of December 31, 2020 the Company had CDARS deposits totaling approximately $4.9 million in exchanged funds and $0 in one-way funds. The Company also relies from time to time on purchased wholesale deposit funding, which is a form of brokered deposits. The Company had $4.2 million in purchased wholesale deposits outstanding at December 31, 2020.

USA Patriot Act. The USA PATRIOT Act is intended to strengthen the ability of U.S. law enforcement and the intelligence community to work cooperatively to combat terrorism on a variety of fronts. The Act contains extensive anti-money laundering and financial transparency provisions and imposes various requirements, including standards for verifying client identification at account opening, and rules to promote cooperation among financial institutions, regulators and law enforcement entities in identifying parties that may be involved in terrorism or money laundering. The Secretary of the Treasury and federal banking regulators have adopted several regulations to implement these provisions. The Act also amended the federal Bank Holding Company Act and the Bank Merger Act to require the federal banking regulatory authorities to consider the effectiveness of a bank holding company or a financial institution’s anti-money laundering activities when reviewing an application to expand operations.

Qualified Mortgage Rules. Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFPB adopted significant amendments to the regulations that implement the Truth in Lending Act. These amendments became effective in January 2014, and address mortgage origination practices by certain housing creditors, including the Bank. These 2014 regulations generally require mortgage lenders to determine consumers’ ability to repay in one of two ways. The first alternative requires the mortgage lender to consider eight underwriting factors when making the credit decision. Alternatively, the mortgage lender can originate so-called qualified mortgages, or “QMs”, which are entitled to a presumption that the creditor making the loan satisfied the ability-to-repay requirements. In general, under the 2014 regulations, a qualified mortgage is a residential mortgage loan that does not have certain high risk features, the points and fees paid by a consumer do not exceed 3% of the total loan amount and the borrower’s total debt-to-income ratio is no higher than 43% (subject to certain limited exceptions for loans eligible for purchase, guarantee or insurance by a government sponsored entity or a federal agency).",section_1,08858900-66e9-4f4a-9864-96a0d88d090f

In December, 2020, the CFPB adopted two rules significantly revising the QM requirements. Among other changes, the first of the new rules simplifies the definition of a QM by creating conclusive and rebuttable presumptions regarding the borrower’s ability to repay. Under the rule, a loan receives a conclusive presumption that the borrower has the ability to repay if the annual percentage rate (APR) does not exceed the average prime offer rate (APOR) for a comparable transaction by 1.5 percentage points or more as of the date the interest rate is set. A loan receives a rebuttable presumption that the borrower has the ability to repay if the annual percentage rate exceeds the APOR for a comparable transaction by 1.5 percentage points or more but by less than 2.25 percentage points. The second of the new CFPB rules creates a new category of “Seasoned QMs” for first-lien, fixed-rate covered transactions that have met certain performance requirements, are held in portfolio by the originating creditor or first purchaser for a 36-month period, comply with general restrictions on product features and points and fees, and meet certain underwriting requirements. A mortgage loan that qualifies as a Seasoned QM loan will receive a presumption of compliance with the ability-to-repay requirements. The new rules became effective on March 1, 2021, with an initial mandatory effective date of July 1, 2021. On March 3, 2021 the CFPB issued a notice of proposed rulemaking to extend the mandatory compliance date to October 1, 2021.",section_1,88ba0580-542a-45f7-ae27-9fcdd5ae409b

A lender originating a QM is protected against a legal claim that the lender failed to comply with the ability-to-repay requirement, whereas a lender originating a mortgage that is not a QM is exposed to the risk of a potential claim that the lender did not comply with the ability-to-repay rules.

Integrated TILA/RESPA (TRID) Disclosures. As required by the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFPB issued rules revising and integrating previously separate disclosures required under the RESPA and TILA in connection with certain closed-end consumer mortgage loans. These final rules became effective in October 2015 and require lenders to provide a new Loan Estimate (which combines content from the former Good Faith Estimate required under RESPA and the initial disclosures required under TILA) not later than the third business day after submission of a loan application, and a new Closing Disclosure (which combines content of the former HUD-1 Settlement Statement required under RESPA and the final disclosures required under TILA) at least three days prior to the loan closing. Other significant changes included in the TRID rules include: (1) expansion of the scope of loans that require RESPA early disclosures, including bridge loans, vacant land loans, and construction loans; (2) changes and additions to “waiting period” requirements to close a loan; (3) reduced tolerances for estimated fees and (4) the lender, rather than the closing agent, is responsible for providing final disclosures.

The Bank became subject to HMDA reporting requirements as a result of its merger with LyndonBank in 2007, as the former LyndonBank branch in Enosburg Falls in Franklin County is included within the Burlington, Vermont MSA. The CFPB’s HMDA rule adopts a dwelling-secured standard for all loans or lines of credit that are for personal, family, or household purposes. Thus, many consumer-purpose transactions, including closed-end home-equity loans, home-equity lines of credit, and reverse mortgages, are subject to the regulation. Most commercial-purpose transactions (i.e., loans or lines of credit not for personal, family, or household purposes) are subject to the regulation only if they are for the purpose of home purchase, home improvement, or refinancing. The rule excludes from coverage home improvement loans that are not secured by a dwelling (i.e., home improvement loans that are unsecured or that are secured by some other type of collateral) and all agricultural-purpose loans and lines of credit. HMDA rule amendments that became effective January 1, 2018 significantly increased the overall amount of data required to be collected and submitted, including additional data points about the applicable loans and expanded data about the borrowers. However, the 2018 Regulatory Relief Act provided an exemption from the requirement to collect these additional data fields for banks that have at least a “Satisfactory” CRA rating that originate fewer than 500 closed-end mortgage loans or fewer than 500 open-end lines of credit per year.

Flood Insurance Reform. The Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2012 (Biggert-Waters Act), as amended by the Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act of 2014, modified the National Flood Insurance Program by: (i) increasing the maximum civil penalty for Flood Disaster Protection Act violations to $2,000 and eliminating the annual penalty cap; (ii) requiring certain lenders to escrow premiums and fees for flood insurance on residential improved real estate; (iii) directing lenders to accept private flood insurance and to notify borrowers of its availability; (iv) amending the force placement requirement provisions; and (v) permitting lenders to charge borrowers costs for lapses in or insufficient coverage. The civil penalty and force placed insurance provisions were effective immediately.
In July 2015, certain federal agencies issued a joint final rule exempting: (1) detached structures that are not used as a residence from the mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements and (2) HELOCs, business purpose loans, nonperforming loans, loans with terms of less than one year, loans for co-ops and condominiums, and subordinate loans on the same property from the mandatory escrow of flood insurance premium requirements. Additionally, the final rule requires certain lenders to escrow flood insurance payments and offer the option to escrow flood insurance premiums on residential improved real estate securing a loan, effective January 1, 2016. New rules effective July 1, 2019, require banks and other regulated financial institutions to accept certain private insurance policies in addition to National Flood Insurance Program policies.",section_1,43ad868f-b2a0-4ca7-aa31-c68a4cb5667f

Reserve Requirements. FRB Regulation D requires all depository institutions to maintain reserves against their transaction accounts (generally, demand deposits, NOW accounts and certain other types of accounts that permit payments or transfers to third parties) and non-personal time deposits (generally, money market deposit accounts or other savings deposits held by corporations or other depositors that are not natural persons, and certain other types of time deposits), subject to certain exemptions, at a level established by the FRB. Because required reserves must be maintained in the form of either vault cash, a non-interest bearing account at the FRBB or a pass through account (as defined by the FRB), the effect of maintaining required reserves is to reduce the amount of the Company’s interest-bearing assets. Effective March 26, 2020, the FRB reduced the required reserve ratio to 0 percent, thereby eliminating the reserve requirement. However, the FRB retains the authority to reimpose a reserve requirement in the future.",section_1,8b558463-a0d3-4b16-9dee-f8750c233f68

Federal Home Loan Bank System. The Bank is a member of the FHLB System, which consists of 12 regional Federal Home Loan Banks. The FHLB provides a central credit facility primarily for member institutions. Member institutions are required to purchase and hold shares of capital stock in the applicable regional FHLB (the FHLBB, in the case of the Bank), in an amount at least equal to the sum of 0.35% of the aggregate principal amount of its unpaid residential mortgage loans and similar obligations at the beginning of each year and 4.5% of its advances (borrowings) from the FHLBB. The Bank was in compliance with this requirement with an investment in FHLBB stock at December 31, 2020 of $768,400.

718413,718413_2020.htm,2020,"FRB Executive Compensation Guidelines. The FRB has issued comprehensive guidance on executive compensation policies, intended to ensure that the incentive compensation practices of banking organizations do not undermine their safety and soundness by encouraging excessive risk-taking. The guidance covers all employees that have the ability to affect materially an institution’s risk profile, either individually or as part of a group, and establishes that incentive compensation arrangements should (1) provide incentives that do not encourage risk-taking beyond the institution’s ability to identify and manage effectively; (2) be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management; and (3) be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by the board of directors. The guidance instructed institutions to begin an immediate review of their incentive compensation policies to ensure that they do not encourage excessive risk-taking and implement corrective programs as needed. Where deficiencies in incentive compensation arrangements exist, they must be immediately addressed. For institutions such as the Company that are not “large, complex banking organizations” as defined in the guidance, the FRB will review the incentive compensation arrangements as part of its regular, risk-focused examination process and not in a separate examination. These examinations will be tailored to the scope and complexity of the institution’s activity and compensation arrangements. The findings will be included in the FRB’s examination report and deficiencies will be incorporated into the institution’s supervisory ratings. Enforcement actions may be taken against an institution if its incentive compensation arrangements, or related risk management control or governance processes, pose a risk to the institution’s safety and soundness and the institution fails to take prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies.",section_1,b5bfbb73-e9a8-49d8-9f5a-ecc12c47a05e

Other Legislative and Regulatory Initiatives. In addition to the statutes, regulations and regulatory initiatives described above, new legislation and regulations affecting financial institutions are frequently proposed. If enacted or adopted, these measures could change banking statutes and the Company’s operating environment in substantial and unpredictable ways and could further increase reporting and compliance requirements, governance structures and costs of doing business. The Company cannot predict whether any such additional legislation or other regulatory initiatives will be adopted or the effect they may have on the Company’s business, results of operations or financial condition.
Effects of Government Monetary Policy
The earnings of the Company are affected by general and local economic conditions and by the policies of various governmental regulatory authorities. In particular, the FRB regulates money supply, credit conditions and interest rates in order to influence general economic conditions, primarily through open market operations in United States Government Securities, varying the discount rate on member bank borrowings, setting reserve requirements against member and nonmember bank deposits, regulating interest rates payable by member banks on time and savings deposits and expanding or contracting the money supply. FRB monetary policies have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks, including the Company, in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future.

Organization and Operation
The Company. The Company was organized under the laws of the State of Vermont in 1982 and became a registered bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, in October 1983 when it acquired all of the voting shares of the Bank, headquartered in Derby, Vermont. The Bank is the only subsidiary of the Company and principally all of the Company's business operations are presently conducted through it. Therefore, the following narrative and the other information about the Company contained in this report are based primarily on the Bank's operations.
The Bank; Banking Services. Community National Bank was organized in 1851 as the Peoples Bank, and was subsequently reorganized as the National Bank of Derby Line in 1865. In 1975, after 110 continuous years of operation as the National Bank of Derby Line, the Bank acquired the Island Pond National Bank and changed its name to ""Community National Bank."" On December 31, 2007, the Company completed its acquisition of LyndonBank, a Vermont bank headquartered in Lyndonville, Vermont, in a cash merger transaction. As a result of the merger, the Company expanded its existing branch network in Caledonia and Orleans Counties and extended it into Lamoille and Franklin Counties. In addition to its main office in Derby, the Company currently maintains eleven branch offices in northeastern and central Vermont and a loan production office in Chittenden County, in northwestern Vermont.
The opportunities for growth continue to be primarily in the Central Vermont and Chittenden County markets where economic activity is more robust than in the Company’s Orleans and Caledonia County markets, and where the Company is increasing its presence and market share. In line with this focus, during the first quarter of 2017 the Company opened its loan production office in Burlington.",section_1,1bec17de-70fe-4296-9219-119c44ed59f0

Related Trust Company. In 2002, the Bank transferred its trust operations to a newly formed Vermont-chartered non-depository trust and investment management company, CFSG, based in Newport, Vermont. The Bank's ownership interest in CFSG is held indirectly, through CFS Partners, a Vermont limited liability company, which owns 100% of the limited liability company equity interests of CFSG. Immediately following transfer of its trust operations to CFSG, the Bank sold a two-thirds interest in CFS Partners, equally to the National Bank of Middlebury, headquartered in Middlebury, Vermont and Guaranty Bancorp Inc., the bank holding company parent of Woodsville Guaranty Savings Bank, headquartered in Woodsville, New Hampshire. CFSG offers fiduciary services throughout the market areas of the three owner financial institutions and leases space from them in some of their branch offices.
Statutory Business Trust. In 2007, the Company formed CMTV Statutory Trust I (the Trust), a Delaware statutory business trust, for the purpose of issuing $12.5 million of trust preferred securities and lending the proceeds to the Company. This funding provided a portion of the cash consideration paid by the Company in the acquisition of LyndonBank and provided additional regulatory capital.

The NMTC financing matured in the fourth quarter of 2018 and the Company exited the investment and terminated its interest in the LLC.

Competition
All of the Bank's banking offices are located in northern and central Vermont. The Bank’s main office is located in Derby, in Orleans County. In addition to its main office, the Bank has four other banking offices in Orleans County, one office in Essex County, two offices in Caledonia County, two offices in Washington County and one office each in Franklin and Lamoille Counties, as well as a loan production office in Chittenden County.

The Bank competes in all aspects of its business with other banks and credit unions in northern and central Vermont, including three of the largest banks operating in the state, which maintain branch offices throughout the Bank's service area. Changes in the regulatory framework of the banking industry during the past decade have broadened the competition for commercial bank products, such as deposits and loans, to include not only traditional rivals such as banks, savings banks and credit unions, but also many non-traditional rivals such as insurance companies, brokerage firms, mutual funds and consumer and commercial finance and leasing companies. In addition, many out-of-market nationwide banks, nonbank lenders and other financial service firms operate in the Company’s market areas through mass marketing solicitations by mail, radio, television, the internet and email. At the same time, technological changes have facilitated remote delivery of financial services by bank and nonbank competitors outside the context of a traditional branch bank network, thereby intensifying competition from out-of-market firms.",section_1,32671f36-0838-4931-8e71-15c78be38d69

Competition from the tax-exempt credit union industry has also intensified in recent years. A number of the Bank’s credit union competitors, including the largest state-chartered Vermont credit union, have converted from an employment based common bond to a community common bond, thereby significantly increasing their fields of membership in the Bank’s market areas. Because federal law subsidizes credit unions by giving them a general exemption from federal income taxes, they have a significant pricing advantage over commercial banks for their deposit and loan products. This pricing advantage, coupled with the relaxing of membership criteria and regulatory restrictions on product offerings, has resulted in increased competition for the Bank from this tax exempt sector of the financial services industry.
In order to compete with other bank and non-bank service providers, the Company stresses the community orientation of its banking operations and relies to a large extent upon personal relationships established by its officers, directors and employees with their customers and on their strong ties to the local community. In addition, management's knowledge of the local community assists it in tailoring the Company's products and services to meet the needs of its customer base. Although competition is strong throughout the Company's market area, management believes that the Company can continue to compete effectively, in view of its local market knowledge and community ties and its understanding of customer needs.

Employees
As of December 31, 2018, the Company did not have any employees at the holding company level. However, as of such date, the Bank employed 123 full-time employees and 12 part-time employees. The Bank is not a party to any collective bargaining agreement and management of the Bank considers its employee relations to be good.
Regulation and Supervision
The following discussion describes elements of an extensive regulatory framework applicable to bank holding companies and banks, to which the Company and the Bank are subject. Regulation of banks and bank holding companies is intended primarily for the protection of depositors and the Deposit Insurance Fund of the FDIC, rather than for the protection of shareholders and creditors.
The Company’s earnings are affected by general economic conditions, management policies, changes in federal and state laws and regulations and actions of various regulatory authorities, including those referred to below. Banking is a highly regulated business and proposals to change the laws and regulations to which the Company and the Bank are subject are frequently introduced at both the federal and state levels. The likelihood and timing of any such changes and the impact such changes may have on the Company and the Bank is impossible to predict with any certainty.

Dodd-Frank Act. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the Dodd-Frank Act) represents a comprehensive revision and restructuring of many aspects of financial services industry regulation and impacts practically all aspects of a banking organization. Many of the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act are designed to reduce systemic risk from large, complex “systemically significant” financial institutions, and thus do not apply to a smaller banking organization such as the Company. Nevertheless, certain of its provisions do directly apply to the Company and others will indirectly impact its operations, as the Dodd-Frank Act continues to reshape the financial services environment. Among other things, the Act:
●
Established a new independent agency, the CFPB, with centralized responsibility for implementing and (with respect to large organizations) enforcing and examining compliance with federal consumer financial laws. Although the CFPB does not have enforcement or examination authority over smaller banking organizations such as the Company, many of its regulatory standards and mandates apply to them, with enforcement authority vested in other regulatory agencies such as (with respect to the Bank) the OCC;
●
Applies the same leverage and risk-based capital requirements that apply to insured depository institutions to most bank holding companies, savings and loan holding companies and systemically important non-bank financial companies on a consolidated basis. These changes prohibit the use of additional trust preferred securities as Tier 1 capital, but the Company’s existing trust preferred securities are grandfathered;

●
Requires debit card interchange transaction fees charged by large financial institutions to be reasonable and proportional to the cost incurred by the issuer for the transaction. The FRB adopted regulations in 2011 establishing such fee standards, eliminating exclusivity arrangements between issuers and networks for debit card transactions and limiting restrictions on merchant discounting for use of certain payment forms and minimum or maximum amount thresholds as a condition for acceptance of credit cards. Although smaller institutions such as the Company are not subject to the interchange fee restrictions, it is possible that, over time, competitive pricing pressures in the marketplace may operate to make the restrictions applicable to them by default;
●
Requires public companies to periodically seek “say on executive pay” and “say on frequency” votes of shareholders, and in some circumstances, a “say on golden parachute” vote of shareholders. These vote requirements first became applicable for the Company’s 2013 annual meeting of shareholders;
●
Allowed depository institutions to pay interest on demand deposits effective July 21, 2011;
●
Established by statute the FRB’s “source of strength” doctrine mandating holding company financial support of subsidiary insured depository institutions;
●
Eliminated state restrictions on de novo interstate branching;
●
Established new requirements related to mortgage lending, including prohibitions against payment of steering incentives and provisions relating to underwriting standards, disclosures, appraisals and escrows. Many of these provisions have been implemented through CFPB rulemakings;

●
Provided permanent relief for non-accelerated filers, from the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for auditor attestation of management’s assessment of internal controls and their effectiveness. Effective with the Company’s periodic reports filed in 2018, this relief was no longer available to the Company as it became an accelerated filer for SEC reporting purposes (see “SEC Reporting and Disclosure Requirements” below);

In particular, section 23A limits loans or other extensions of credit to, asset purchases with and investments in affiliates of the Bank to 10% of the Bank’s capital and surplus. In addition, such loans and extensions of credit and certain other transactions must be collateralized in specified amounts. Section 23B requires, among other things, that certain transactions between the Bank and its affiliates must be on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the Bank, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with or involving non-affiliated persons. Further, the Company is prohibited from engaging in certain tie-in arrangements in connection with any extension of credit or lease or sale of any property or the furnishing of services.
Capital Adequacy Requirements. Revised regulatory capital rules were adopted in July 2013 by the federal banking regulators to implement the Basel III capital standards and certain capital requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act. The effect of the rules was to impose higher minimum capital requirements for bank holding companies and banks. The rules apply to all national and state banks and savings associations regardless of size and bank holding companies and savings and loan holding companies with $500 million or more in total consolidated assets. More stringent requirements apply to certain larger banking organizations. The requirements in the rule began to phase in on January 1, 2015, for the Company and the Bank and was fully phased in on January 1, 2019.",section_1,005a7148-77ea-40b6-8ba6-1d56defd642e

The Basel III capital rules include certain new and higher risk-based capital and leverage requirements than those previously in place. Specifically, the following minimum capital requirements now apply to the Company and the Bank:
●
a new common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 4.5%;
●
a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6% (increased from the former 4% requirement);
●
a total risk-based capital ratio of 8% (unchanged from the former requirement); and
●
a leverage ratio of 4% (also unchanged from the former requirement).
Under the rules, Tier 1 capital is redefined to include two components: Common Equity Tier 1 capital and additional Tier 1 capital. The new and highest form of capital, Common Equity Tier 1 capital, consists solely of common stock (plus related surplus), retained earnings, accumulated other comprehensive income, and limited amounts of minority interests that are in the form of common stock. Additional Tier 1 capital includes other perpetual instruments historically included in Tier 1 capital, such as noncumulative perpetual preferred stock. Tier 2 capital consists of instruments that currently qualify in Tier 2 capital plus instruments that the rule has disqualified from Tier 1 capital treatment. Cumulative perpetual preferred stock, formerly includable in Tier 1 capital, is now included only in Tier 2 capital. Although AOCI is presumptively included in Common Equity Tier 1 capital, the rule provided a one-time opportunity at the end of the first quarter of 2015 for covered banking organizations to opt out of much of this treatment of AOCI. The Company and Bank made this opt-out election and, as a result, will retain the pre-existing regulatory capital treatment for AOCI.",section_1,bf77be02-600f-4d7f-8bfb-6bf2bd392cf1

In addition, in order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions or discretionary bonus payments to executives, a covered banking organization must maintain a “capital conservation buffer” on top of its minimum risk-based capital requirements. This buffer must consist solely of Tier 1 Common Equity, but the buffer applies to all three measurements (Common Equity Tier 1, Tier 1 capital and total capital). The capital conservation buffer was phased in incrementally over time and became fully effective on January 1, 2019, consisting of an additional amount of common equity equal to 2.5% of risk-weighted assets. The Company and the Bank satisfied this fully-phased in capital conservation buffer. Failure to maintain the required buffer would result in limitations on permissible shareholder distributions and discretionary bonus payments.
In general, the rules have had the effect of increasing capital requirements by increasing the risk weights on certain assets, including high volatility commercial real estate, certain loans past due 90 days or more or in nonaccrual status, mortgage servicing rights not includable in Common Equity Tier 1 capital, equity exposures, and claims on securities firms, that are used in the denominator of the three risk-based capital ratios.
The Company’s capital ratios exceeded all applicable regulatory requirements at December 31, 2018. (See Note 20 to the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information about the Company’s and the Bank’s regulatory capital ratios.)

The 2018 Regulatory Relief Act provides relief from the foregoing Basel III capital standards for qualifying community banks (generally, well-capitalized banks under $10 billion in assets). The Act authorizes the federal banking agencies to establish a new community bank leverage ratio (CBLR) of tangible equity capital to average consolidated assets, of between 8% and 10%. A qualifying community bank that exceeds the CBLR percentage established by the federal banking regulators will be deemed well capitalized for purposes of capital adequacy requirements and the FDIC’s Prompt Corrective Action framework, and would not be subject to risk based capital and other leverage requirements.

Management's report on internal control over financial reporting for 2017 is contained in Item 9A of this Report. The Company has incurred, and expects to continue to incur, costs in connection with its on-going compliance with Section 404.

Dividends. The Company derives funds for payment of dividends to its shareholders primarily from dividends received from its subsidiary, Community National Bank. Under the National Bank Act, prior approval from the OCC is required if the total of all dividends declared by a national bank in any calendar year will exceed the sum of such bank's net profits for that last year and its retained net profits for the preceding two calendar years, less any required transfers to surplus. Federal law also prohibits national banks from paying dividends greater than the bank's undivided profits after deducting statutory bad debt in excess of the bank's ALL.
The Company and the Bank are also subject to various general regulatory policies and requirements relating to the payment of dividends, including requirements to maintain adequate capital above regulatory minimums. The appropriate federal or state banking agency is authorized to determine under certain circumstances relating to the financial condition of a bank or bank holding company that the payment of dividends would be an unsafe or unsound practice and to prohibit such payment. In addition, under the Basel III capital requirements, failure to maintain the required capital conservation buffer would result in additional limitations on permissible shareholder distributions.",section_1,584f3120-a184-41e7-a1a3-e49becdc9423

The FRB has issued supervisory guidance on the payment of dividends and redemption and repurchases of stock by bank holding companies reflecting the expectation that a bank holding company will inform and consult with FRB supervisory staff in advance of declaring and paying any dividend that could raise safety and soundness concerns. Examples of actions that might raise such concerns include declaration of a dividend exceeding current period earnings; redeeming or repurchasing regulatory capital instruments when the bank holding company is experiencing financial weaknesses; or redeeming or repurchasing common stock or perpetual preferred stock that would result in a net reduction in the amount of such equity instruments outstanding compared with the beginning of the quarter in which the redemption or repurchase occurred. The guidance provides that a bank holding company should eliminate, defer or severely limit dividends if net income for the past four quarters is not sufficient to fully fund dividends; the prospective rate of earnings retention is not consistent with the holding company’s capital needs and overall current and prospective financial condition; or the holding company will not meet, or is in danger of not meeting, its minimum regulatory capital ratios.",section_1,d92ca504-fd2f-46a7-ba97-a1a22cc599ec

OCC Supervision. As a national banking association, the Bank is subject to the provisions of the National Bank Act and federal and state statutes and rules and regulations applicable to national banks. The primary supervisory authority for the Bank is the OCC. The Bank is subject to periodic examination by the OCC and must file periodic reports with the OCC containing a complete statement of its financial condition and results of operations. The OCC's examinations are designed for the protection of the Bank's depositors and not the Company’s shareholders.
The CFPB created by the Dodd-Frank Act took over responsibility for enforcing the principal federal consumer protection laws, such as the Truth in Lending Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act and the Truth in Saving Act, among others, in 2011. Institutions that have assets of $10 billion or less, such as our Bank subsidiary, will continue to be supervised and examined in this area by their primary federal regulators (in the case of our Bank subsidiary, the OCC). However, the Dodd-Frank Act gives the CFPB expanded data collecting powers for fair lending purposes for both small business and mortgage loans, as well as expanded authority to prevent unfair, deceptive and abusive practices.",section_1,43557998-da7a-4bc6-a971-3d891ce68cd0

Prompt Corrective Action. The Bank is subject to regulatory capital requirements established under FDICIA. Among other things, FDICIA identifies five capital categories for insured depository institutions (well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized) and requires the respective U.S. federal regulatory agencies to implement systems for ""prompt corrective action"" for insured depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements within such categories. FDICIA imposes progressively more restrictive constraints on operations, management and capital distributions, depending on the category in which an institution is classified. Failure to meet the capital guidelines could also subject a banking institution to capital raising requirements. An ""undercapitalized"" bank must develop a capital restoration plan and its parent holding company must guarantee that bank's compliance with the plan. The liability of the parent holding company under any such guarantee is limited to the lesser of 5% of the bank's assets at the time it became undercapitalized or the amount needed to comply with the plan. Furthermore, in the event of the bankruptcy of the parent holding company, such guarantee would take priority over the parent's general unsecured creditors. In addition, FDICIA requires the various regulatory agencies to prescribe certain non-capital standards for safety and soundness related generally to operations and management, asset quality and executive compensation and permits regulatory action against a financial institution that does not meet such standards.",section_1,f8a74872-e5e0-48d9-91d0-050fba2f00ed
718413,718413_2018.htm,2018,"and soundness related generally to operations and management, asset quality and executive compensation and permits regulatory action against a financial institution that does not meet such standards.
The federal bank regulatory agencies, including the OCC, have adopted substantially similar regulations that define the five capital categories identified by FDICIA. These regulations establish various degrees of corrective action to be taken when an FDIC-insured depository institution is considered undercapitalized. Effective January 1, 2015, the FDIC’s Prompt Corrective Action regulations were revised in accordance with the Basel III capital standards. The enhanced requirements (i) introduce a Common Equity Tier 1 ratio requirement at each capital category (other than critically undercapitalized), and set the required Common Equity Tier 1 ratio at 6.5% for well-capitalized status; (ii) increase the minimum Tier 1 capital ratio requirement for each category (other than critically undercapitalized), and set the minimum Tier 1 capital ratio for well-capitalized status at 8.0% (as compared to 6.0% under the prior rule); and (iii) eliminate the provision that permitted a bank with a composite supervisory rating of 1 to have a 3% leverage ratio and still be considered adequately capitalized. The Basel III capital standards do not change the total risk-based capital requirement for any prompt corrective action category.
As of December 31, 2018, the Bank was considered ""well capitalized"" under FDICIA’s Prompt Corrective Action capital requirements. (See Note 20 to the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information about the Bank’s regulatory capital ratios.)",section_1,a6c46138-8341-4006-9e28-9082ef9b92af

As discussed above under “Capital Adequacy Requirements,” the 2018 Regulatory Relief Act provides relief from the foregoing Prompt Corrective Action requirements for qualifying community banks that satisfy a specified community bank leverage ratio of tangible equity capital to average consolidated assets, of between 8% and 10%. However, as of the date of this report, the federal banking agencies had not yet established the CBLR percentage.
Deposit Insurance. The deposits of the Bank are insured by the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) of the FDIC up to the limits set forth under applicable law and are subject to the deposit insurance premium assessments of the DIF. The FDIC imposes a risk-based deposit premium assessments system, which was amended pursuant to the Federal Deposit Insurance Reform Act of 2005 and further amended by the Dodd-Frank Act. Under this system, as amended, the assessment rates for an insured depository institution vary according to the level of risk incurred in its activities. To arrive at an assessment rate for a banking institution, the FDIC places it in one of four risk categories determined by reference to its capital levels and supervisory ratings. In addition, in the case of those institutions in the lowest risk category, the FDIC further determines its assessment rate based on certain specified financial ratios or, if applicable, its long-term debt ratings. The assessment rate schedule can change from time to time, at the discretion of the FDIC, subject to certain limits. In addition, all FDIC insured depository institutions are required to pay a pro rata portion of the interest due on the obligations issued by the FICO to fund the closing and disposal of failed thrift institutions by the Resolution Trust Corporation.",section_1,27cec5ab-4fdb-456b-bc49-0ce4dbc37796

Brokered Deposits. Under FDICIA, an FDIC-insured bank is prohibited from accepting brokered deposits without prior approval of the FDIC unless it is well capitalized under the FDICIA's prompt corrective actions guidelines. The Company participates in the CDARS of the Promontory Interfinancial Network, which uses a deposit-matching engine to match CDARS deposits in other participating banks, dollar-for-dollar. This product, also known as reciprocal deposits, is designed to provide deposit insurance in excess of FDIC limits and thereby enhance customer attraction and retention, build deposits and improve net interest margins. Until recently reciprocal deposits were considered a form of brokered deposits, which are treated less favorably than other deposits for certain purposes; however, a provision of the 2018 Regulatory Relief Act provides that reciprocal deposits held by a well-capitalized and well managed bank are no longer classified as brokered deposits. CDARS also permits the “one-way” purchase of deposits, which the Company utilizes from time to time for liquidity management purposes. CDARS one-way deposits are considered brokered deposits for certain purposes under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and FDIC regulations. As of December 31, 2018 the Company had CDARS deposits totaling $3.5 million in exchanged funds and $723,774 in one-way funds. The Company also relies from time to time on purchased wholesale deposit funding, which is a form of brokered deposits.

The Act contains extensive anti-money laundering and financial transparency provisions and imposes various requirements, including standards for verifying client identification at account opening, and rules to promote cooperation among financial institutions, regulators and law enforcement entities in identifying parties that may be involved in terrorism or money laundering. The Secretary of the Treasury and federal banking regulators have adopted several regulations to implement these provisions. The Act also amended the federal Bank Holding Company Act and the Bank Merger Act to require the federal banking regulatory authorities to consider the effectiveness of a bank holding company or a financial institution’s anti-money laundering activities when reviewing an application to expand operations.

The AML program is also designed to ensure there are appropriate methods of monitoring transactions and account relationships to identify potentially suspicious activity and report suspicious activity to governmental authorities in accordance with applicable laws, rules and regulations. In addition, the AML program requires the training of appropriate personnel with regard to AML and anti-terrorist financing issues and provides for independent testing to ensure that the AML program is in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.

Qualified Mortgage Rules. Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFPB adopted significant amendments to the regulations that implement the Truth in Lending Act. These amendments, which became effective January 10, 2014, address mortgage origination practices by certain housing creditors, including the Bank, and generally require mortgage lenders to determine consumers’ ability to repay in one of two ways. The first alternative requires the mortgage lender to consider eight underwriting factors when making the credit decision. Alternatively, the mortgage lender can originate so-called ""qualified mortgages (QMs),"" which are entitled to a presumption that the creditor making the loan satisfied the ability-to-repay requirements. In general, a qualified mortgage is a residential mortgage loan that does not have certain high risk features, such as negative amortization, interest-only payments, balloon payments, or a term exceeding 30 years. In addition, to be a qualified mortgage, the points and fees paid by a consumer cannot exceed 3% of the total loan amount and the borrower’s total debt-to-income ratio must be no higher than 43% (subject to certain limited exceptions for loans eligible for purchase, guarantee or insurance by a government sponsored entity or a federal agency).",section_1,818f8d33-5762-4198-9454-71dbf38e8734

A lender originating a QM is protected against a legal claim that the lender failed to comply with the ability-to-repay requirement. A lender originating a mortgage that is not a QM is exposed to the risk of a potential claim that the lender did not comply with the ability-to-repay rules, which could require the lender to pay damages to the borrower, and could impair the lender’s ability to enforce the loan terms or foreclose on the real estate collateral. The ability-to-repay requirement creates a new basis for after-the-fact challenge of QM status by regulators and by consumers and its future interpretation by the courts may create substantial legal uncertainty. The CFPB’s mission is consumer protection, not lender safety and soundness, and for that reason the CFPB wrote the ability-to-repay rule with the goal of preventing consumers from being steered by lenders into expensive and unsustainable borrowing, rather than with the goal of assuring loan repayment. Accordingly, typical credit-quality features such as loan-to-value standards are not elements of the ability-to-repay rule, and it will not necessarily be the case that QMs have a higher probability or history of repayment than other mortgages.

Integrated TILA/RESPA (TRID) Disclosures. As required by the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFPB issued final rules in 2013 revising and integrating previously separate disclosures required under the RESPA and TILA in connection with certain closed-end consumer mortgage loans. These final rules became effective in October 2015 and require lenders to provide a new Loan Estimate (which combines content from the former Good Faith Estimate required under RESPA and the initial disclosures required under TILA) not later than the third business day after submission of a loan application, and a new Closing Disclosure (which combines content of the former HUD-1 Settlement Statement required under RESPA and the final disclosures required under TILA) at least three days prior to the loan closing. Other significant changes included in the TRID rules include: (1) expansion of the scope of loans that require RESPA early disclosures, including bridge loans, vacant land loans, and construction loans; (2) changes and additions to “waiting period” requirements to close a loan; (3) reduced tolerances for estimated fees and (4) the lender, rather than the closing agent, is responsible for providing final disclosures.

Community Reinvestment Act. The Federal CRA requires banks to define the communities they serve, identify the credit needs of those communities, collect and maintain data for each small business or small farm loan originated or purchased by the Bank, and maintain a Public File at each location. The federal banking regulators examine the institutions they regulate for compliance with the CRA and assign one of the following four ratings: “outstanding,” “satisfactory,” “needs to improve” or “substantial noncompliance”. The rating assigned reflects the bank’s record of helping to meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, consistent with the safe and sound operation of the bank. As of the Bank’s last CRA examination, completed during 2017, it received a rating of “Outstanding”.",section_1,3123574d-6217-4d17-a27e-bae9a4dc368d

718413,718413_2018.htm,2018,"Home Mortgage Disclosure Act. The federal HMDA, which is implemented by CFPB’s Regulation C, requires mortgage lenders that maintain offices within MSAs to report and make available to the public specified information regarding their residential mortgage lending activities, such as the pricing of home mortgage loans, including the “rate spread” between the interest rate on loans and certain treasury securities and other benchmarks. The Bank became subject to HMDA reporting requirements as a result of its merger with LyndonBank in 2007, as the former LyndonBank branch in Enosburg Falls in Franklin County is included within the Burlington, Vermont MSA. In July 2015, the CFPB implemented and expanded new HMDA rules. The final rule adopts a dwelling-secured standard for all loans or lines of credit that are for personal, family, or household purposes. Thus, many consumer-purpose transactions, including closed-end home-equity loans, home-equity lines of credit, and reverse mortgages, are subject to the regulation. Most commercial-purpose transactions (i.e., loans or lines of credit not for personal, family, or household purposes) are subject to the regulation only if they are for the purpose of home purchase, home improvement, or refinancing. The final rule excludes from coverage home improvement loans that are not secured by a dwelling (i.e., home improvement loans that are unsecured or that are secured by some other type of collateral) and all agricultural-purpose loans and lines of credit. New HMDA rules that became effective January 1, 2018 significantly increased the overall amount of data required to be collected and submitted, including additional data points about the applicable loans and expanded data about the borrowers.

Flood Insurance Reform. The Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2012 (Biggert-Waters Act), as amended by the Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act of 2014, modified the National Flood Insurance Program by: (i) increasing the maximum civil penalty for Flood Disaster Protection Act violations to $2,000 and eliminating the annual penalty cap; (ii) requiring certain lenders to escrow premiums and fees for flood insurance on residential improved real estate; (iii) directing lenders to accept private flood insurance and to notify borrowers of its availability; (iv) amending the force placement requirement provisions; and (v) permitting lenders to charge borrowers costs for lapses in or insufficient coverage. The civil penalty and force placed insurance provisions were effective immediately.
In July 2015, certain federal agencies issued a joint final rule exempting: (1) detached structures that are not used as a residence from the mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements and (2) HELOCs, business purpose loans, nonperforming loans, loans with terms of less than one year, loans for co-ops and condominiums, and subordinate loans on the same property from the mandatory escrow of flood insurance premium requirements. Additionally, the final rule requires certain lenders to escrow flood insurance payments and offer the option to escrow flood insurance premiums on residential improved real estate securing a loan, effective January 1, 2016. New rules, which take effect July 1, 2019, will require banks and other regulated financial institutions to accept certain private insurance policies in addition to National Flood Insurance Program policies.",section_1,a1a24fad-340e-4f38-940d-fb5b80a71427

Federal Home Loan Bank System. The Bank is a member of the FHLB System, which consists of 12 regional Federal Home Loan Banks. The FHLB provides a central credit facility primarily for member institutions. Member institutions are required to purchase and hold shares of capital stock in the applicable regional FHLB (the FHLBB, in the case of the Bank), in an amount at least equal to the sum of 0.35% of the aggregate principal amount of its unpaid residential mortgage loans and similar obligations at the beginning of each year and 4.5% of its advances (borrowings) from the FHLBB. The Bank was in compliance with this requirement with an investment in FHLBB stock at December 31, 2018 of approximately $1.1 million. During 2009, the FHLBB experienced significant net operating losses, and as a result temporarily ceased paying dividends on its stock and instituted a moratorium on stock repurchases and redemptions. In 2011, the FHLBB resumed paying dividends, but at a more modest rate than previous years and in February 2012 it lifted the moratorium on stock redemptions. As a member, the Bank is subject to future capital calls by the FHLBB in order to maintain compliance with its capital plan.",section_1,cc757701-66e4-45a2-8140-bad32e53b670

In 2009, the FRB issued comprehensive guidance on executive compensation policies, intended to ensure that the incentive compensation practices of banking organizations do not undermine their safety and soundness by encouraging excessive risk-taking. The guidance covers all employees that have the ability to affect materially an institution's risk profile, either individually or as part of a group, and establishes that incentive compensation arrangements should (1) provide incentives that do not encourage risk-taking beyond the institution's ability to identify and manage effectively; (2) be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management; and (3) be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by the board of directors. The guidance instructed institutions to begin an immediate review of their incentive compensation policies to ensure that they do not encourage excessive risk-taking and implement corrective programs as needed. Where deficiencies in incentive compensation arrangements exist, they must be immediately addressed. For institutions such as the Company that are not ""large, complex banking organizations"" as defined in the guidance, the FRB will review the incentive compensation arrangements as part of its regular, risk-focused examination process and not in a separate examination. These examinations will be tailored to the scope and complexity of the institution's activity and compensation arrangements. The findings will be included in the FRB's examination report and deficiencies will be incorporated into the institution's supervisory ratings.

Other Legislative and Regulatory Initiatives. In addition to the statutes, regulations and regulatory initiatives described above, new legislation and regulations affecting financial institutions are frequently proposed. If enacted or adopted, these measures could change banking statutes and the Company's operating environment in substantial and unpredictable ways and could further increase reporting and compliance requirements, governance structures and costs of doing business. The Company cannot predict whether any such additional legislation or other regulatory initiatives will be adopted or the effect they may have on the Company's business, results of operations or financial condition.
Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The 2017 Tax Act significantly changed corporate income tax law by reducing the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018, creating a territorial tax system, allowing for immediate capital expensing of certain qualified property, and eliminating the deductibility of DIF assessments.

The earnings of the Company are affected by general and local economic conditions and by the policies of various governmental regulatory authorities. In particular, the FRB regulates money supply, credit conditions and interest rates in order to influence general economic conditions, primarily through open market operations in United States Government Securities, varying the discount rate on member bank borrowings, setting reserve requirements against member and nonmember bank deposits, regulating interest rates payable by member banks on time and savings deposits and expanding or contracting the money supply.

Organization and Operation
The Company. The Company was organized under the laws of the State of Vermont in 1982 and became a registered bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, in October 1983 when it acquired all of the voting shares of the Bank, headquartered in Derby, Vermont. The Bank is the only subsidiary of the Company and principally all of the Company's business operations are presently conducted through it. Therefore, the following narrative and the other information about the Company contained in this report are based primarily on the Bank's operations.
The Bank; Banking Services. Community National Bank was organized in 1851 as the Peoples Bank, and was subsequently reorganized as the National Bank of Derby Line in 1865. In 1975, after 110 continuous years of operation as the National Bank of Derby Line, the Bank acquired the Island Pond National Bank and changed its name to ""Community National Bank."" On December 31, 2007, the Company completed its acquisition of LyndonBank, a Vermont bank headquartered in Lyndonville, Vermont, in a cash merger transaction. As a result of the merger, the Company expanded its existing branch network in Caledonia and Orleans Counties and extended it into Lamoille and Franklin Counties. In addition to its main office in Derby, the Company currently maintains eleven branch offices in northeastern and central Vermont and a loan production office in Chittenden County, in northwestern Vermont, and in 2019, the Company opened a loan production office in Grafton County, in western New Hampshire.",section_1,8be2f5a2-544b-48f8-8c97-3f5d49d86eb3

The opportunities for growth continue to be primarily in the Central Vermont and Chittenden County markets where economic activity is more robust than in the Company’s Orleans and Caledonia County markets, and where the Company is increasing its presence and market share. The Company is also focusing on expanding its presence in the neighboring state of New Hampshire through the opening of its loan production office in Lebanon, New Hampshire.
The Company, through the Bank, provides a broad range of retail banking services to the residents, businesses, nonprofit organizations and municipalities in its northern and central Vermont markets. Significant services offered by the Company include:
●
Business Banking - The Company offers a range of credit products for a variety of general business purposes, including financing for commercial business properties, equipment, inventories and accounts receivable, as well as letters of credit.

Related Trust Company. In 2002, the Bank transferred its trust operations to a newly formed Vermont-chartered non-depository trust and investment management company, CFSG, based in Newport, Vermont. The Bank's ownership interest in CFSG is held indirectly, through CFS Partners, a Vermont limited liability company, which owns 100% of the limited liability company equity interests of CFSG.

The Bank also competes with bank and non-bank lenders in Chittenden County, Vermont and Grafton County, New Hampshire where it maintains loan production offices.

In addition, many out-of-market nationwide banks, nonbank lenders and other financial service firms operate in the Company’s market areas through mass marketing solicitations by mail, radio, television, the internet and email.

Competition from the tax-exempt credit union industry has also intensified in recent years. A number of the Bank’s credit union competitors, including the largest state-chartered Vermont credit union, have converted from an employment based common bond to a community common bond, thereby significantly increasing their fields of membership in the Bank’s market areas. Because federal law subsidizes credit unions by giving them a general exemption from federal income taxes, they have a significant pricing advantage over commercial banks for their deposit and loan products. This pricing advantage, coupled with the relaxing of membership criteria and regulatory restrictions on product offerings, has resulted in increased competition for the Bank from this tax exempt sector of the financial services industry.
In order to compete with other bank and non-bank service providers, the Company stresses the community orientation of its banking operations and relies to a large extent upon personal relationships established by its officers, directors and employees with their customers and on their strong ties to the local community. In addition, management's knowledge of the local community assists it in tailoring the Company's products and services to meet the needs of its customer base. Although competition is strong throughout the Company's market area, management believes that the Company can continue to compete effectively, in view of its local market knowledge and community ties and its understanding of customer needs.

As of December 31, 2019, the Company did not have any employees at the holding company level. However, as of such date, the Bank employed 123 full-time employees and 13 part-time employees. The Bank is not a party to any collective bargaining agreement and management of the Bank considers its employee relations to be good.
Regulation and Supervision
The following discussion describes elements of an extensive regulatory framework applicable to bank holding companies and banks, to which the Company and the Bank are subject. Regulation of banks and bank holding companies is intended primarily for the protection of depositors and the Deposit Insurance Fund of the FDIC, rather than for the protection of shareholders and creditors.
The Company’s earnings are affected by general economic conditions, management policies, changes in federal and state laws and regulations and actions of various regulatory authorities, including those referred to below. Banking is a highly regulated business and proposals to change the laws and regulations to which the Company and the Bank are subject are frequently introduced at both the federal and state levels. The likelihood and timing of any such changes and the impact such changes may have on the Company and the Bank is impossible to predict with any certainty.

Dodd-Frank Act. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the Dodd-Frank Act) represents a comprehensive revision and restructuring of many aspects of financial services industry regulation and impacts practically all aspects of a banking organization. Many of the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act are designed to reduce systemic risk from large, complex “systemically significant” financial institutions, and thus do not apply to a smaller banking organization such as the Company. Nevertheless, certain of its provisions do directly apply to the Company and others will indirectly impact its operations, as the Dodd-Frank Act continues to reshape the financial services environment. Among other things, the Act:
●
Established a new independent agency, the CFPB, with centralized responsibility for implementing and (with respect to large organizations) enforcing and examining compliance with federal consumer financial laws. Although the CFPB does not have enforcement or examination authority over smaller banking organizations such as the Company, many of its regulatory standards and mandates apply to them, with enforcement authority vested in other regulatory agencies such as (with respect to the Bank) the OCC;
●
Applies the same leverage and risk-based capital requirements that apply to insured depository institutions to most bank holding companies, savings and loan holding companies and systemically important non-bank financial companies on a consolidated basis. These changes prohibit the use of additional trust preferred securities as Tier 1 capital, but the Company’s existing trust preferred securities are grandfathered;

●
Requires debit card interchange transaction fees charged by large financial institutions to be reasonable and proportional to the cost incurred by the issuer for the transaction. The FRB adopted regulations in 2011 establishing such fee standards, eliminating exclusivity arrangements between issuers and networks for debit card transactions and limiting restrictions on merchant discounting for use of certain payment forms and minimum or maximum amount thresholds as a condition for acceptance of credit cards. Although smaller institutions such as the Company are not subject to the interchange fee restrictions, it is possible that, over time, competitive pricing pressures in the marketplace may operate to make the restrictions applicable to them by default;
●
Requires public companies to periodically seek “say on executive pay” and “say on frequency” votes of shareholders, and in some circumstances, a “say on golden parachute” vote of shareholders. These vote requirements first became applicable for the Company’s 2013 annual meeting of shareholders;
●
Allowed depository institutions to pay interest on demand deposits effective July 21, 2011;
●
Established by statute the FRB’s “source of strength” doctrine mandating holding company financial support of subsidiary insured depository institutions;
●
Eliminated state restrictions on de novo interstate branching;
●
Established new requirements related to residential mortgage lending, including prohibitions against payment of steering incentives and provisions relating to underwriting standards, disclosures, appraisals and escrows. Many of these provisions have been implemented through CFPB rulemakings;

●
Weakened federal preemption standards for national banks and federal savings associations and their operating subsidiaries by granting states greater authority to enforce consumer protection laws against them;
●
Provided permanent relief for non-accelerated filers, from the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for auditor attestation of management’s assessment of internal controls and their effectiveness. Effective with the Company’s periodic reports filed in 2018, this relief was no longer available to the Company as it became an accelerated filer for SEC reporting purposes (see “SEC Reporting and Disclosure Requirements” below);
●
Requires a bank holding company to be well capitalized and well managed to receive regulatory approval of an interstate bank acquisition; and
●
Permanently increased the FDIC’s standard maximum deposit insurance amount to $250,000, changed the FDIC insurance assessment base to assets rather than deposits and increased the reserve ratio for the deposit insurance fund to ensure the future strength of the fund.

Bank Holding Company Act. As a registered bank holding company, the Company is subject to on-going regulation, supervision and examination by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB), under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the Act). A bank holding company for example, must generally obtain the prior approval of the FRB before it acquires all or substantially all of the assets of any bank, or acquires ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares of a bank. FRB approval is also generally required before a bank holding company may acquire more than 5% of any outstanding class of voting securities of a company other than a bank or a more than 5% interest in its property. also generally required before a bank holding company may acquire more than 5% of any outstanding class of voting securities of a company other than a bank or a more than 5% interest in its property.",section_1,fae3b06a-d1c6-4cd1-ac0a-abf2f4381acc

Trust and investment management activities conducted through a non-depository trust company such as the Company's affiliate, CFSG, are also considered by the FRB to be permissible nonbanking activities that are closely related to banking.
Except for CFSG’s trust and investment management operations, the Company does not presently engage, directly or indirectly through any affiliate, in any other permissible non-banking activities.
A bank holding company must obtain prior FRB approval in order to purchase or redeem its own stock if the gross consideration to be paid, when added to the net consideration paid by the company for all purchases or redemptions by the company of its equity securities within the preceding 12 months, will equal 10% or more of the company's consolidated net worth.

In particular, section 23A limits loans or other extensions of credit to, asset purchases with and investments in affiliates of the Bank to 10% of the Bank’s capital and surplus. In addition, such loans and extensions of credit and certain other transactions must be collateralized in specified amounts. Section 23B requires, among other things, that certain transactions between the Bank and its affiliates must be on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the Bank, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with or involving non-affiliated persons. Further, the Company is prohibited from engaging in certain tie-in arrangements in connection with any extension of credit or lease or sale of any property or the furnishing of services.
Capital Adequacy Requirements. Revised regulatory capital rules were adopted in July 2013 by the federal banking regulators to implement the Basel III capital standards and certain capital requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act. The effect of the rules was to impose higher minimum capital requirements for bank holding companies and banks. The rules apply to all national and state banks and savings associations regardless of size and bank holding companies and savings and loan holding companies with $500 million or more in total consolidated assets. More stringent requirements apply to certain larger banking organizations. The requirements in the rule were fully phased in on January 1, 2019, for the Company and the Bank.",section_1,28c45063-9591-48c3-ad08-44303663cec9

The Basel III capital rules include certain new and higher risk-based capital and leverage requirements than those previously in place. Specifically, the following minimum capital requirements now apply to the Company and the Bank:
●
a new common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 4.5%;
●
a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6% (increased from the former 4% requirement);
●
a total risk-based capital ratio of 8% (unchanged from the former requirement); and
●
a leverage ratio of 4% (also unchanged from the former requirement).
Under the rules, Tier 1 capital is redefined to include two components: Common Equity Tier 1 capital and additional Tier 1 capital. The new and highest form of capital, Common Equity Tier 1 capital, consists solely of common stock (plus related surplus), retained earnings, accumulated other comprehensive income, and limited amounts of minority interests that are in the form of common stock. Additional Tier 1 capital includes other perpetual instruments historically included in Tier 1 capital, such as noncumulative perpetual preferred stock. Tier 2 capital consists of instruments that currently qualify in Tier 2 capital plus instruments that the rule has disqualified from Tier 1 capital treatment. Cumulative perpetual preferred stock, formerly includable in Tier 1 capital, is now included only in Tier 2 capital. Although AOCI is presumptively included in Common Equity Tier 1 capital, the rule provided a one-time opportunity at the end of the first quarter of 2015 for covered banking organizations to opt out of much of this treatment of AOCI. The Company and Bank made this opt-out election and, as a result, will retain the pre-existing regulatory capital treatment for AOCI.",section_1,449aa861-b4c2-4c8a-b37c-d9bb99c58418
718413,718413_2019.htm,2019,"organizations to opt out of much of this treatment of AOCI. The Company and Bank made this opt-out election and, as a result, will retain the pre-existing regulatory capital treatment for AOCI.
In addition, in order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions or discretionary bonus payments to executives, a covered banking organization must maintain a “capital conservation buffer” on top of its minimum risk-based capital requirements. This buffer must consist solely of Tier 1 Common Equity, but the buffer applies to all three measurements (Common Equity Tier 1, Tier 1 capital and total capital). The capital conservation buffer was phased in incrementally over time and became fully effective on January 1, 2019, consisting of an additional amount of common equity equal to 2.5% of risk-weighted assets. The Company and the Bank satisfied this fully-phased in capital conservation buffer. Failure to maintain the required buffer would result in limitations on permissible shareholder distributions and discretionary bonus payments.
In general, the rules have had the effect of increasing capital requirements by increasing the risk weights on certain assets, including high volatility commercial real estate, certain loans past due 90 days or more or in nonaccrual status, mortgage servicing rights not includable in Common Equity Tier 1 capital, equity exposures, and claims on securities firms, that are used in the denominator of the three risk-based capital ratios.
The Company’s capital ratios exceeded all applicable regulatory requirements at December 31, 2019. (See Note 21 to the Company’s audited consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for additional information about the Company’s and the Bank’s regulatory capital ratios.)
The Basel III capital standards also revised the FDIC’s “prompt corrective action” requirements (see “Prompt Corrective Action” below).",section_1,fd1154aa-c96b-43c5-8852-27326dac3664

The Basel III capital standards also revised the FDIC’s “prompt corrective action” requirements (see “Prompt Corrective Action” below).
Under the 2018 Regulatory Relief Act, these capital requirements have been simplified for qualifying community banks and bank holding companies. In September 2019, the OCC and the other federal bank regulators approved a final joint rule that permits a qualifying community banking organization to opt in to a simplified regulatory capital framework. A qualifying institution that elects to utilize the simplified framework must maintain a CBLR in excess of 9%, and will thereby be deemed to have satisfied the generally applicable risk-based and other leverage capital requirements and (if applicable) the FDIC’s prompt corrective action framework. In order to utilize the CBLR framework, in addition to maintaining a CBLR of over 9%, a community banking organization must have less than $10 billion in total consolidated assets and must meet certain other criteria such as limitations on the amount of off-balance sheet exposures and on trading assets and liabilities. The CBLR will be calculated by dividing tangible equity capital by average total consolidated assets. The final rule became effective on January 1, 2020, and as of that date the Company and Bank qualify to utilize the CBLR framework.",section_1,92e03865-153b-4d02-b2a9-bbc19d998f52

Sarbanes-Oxley Act. SOX was enacted to increase corporate responsibility, to provide for enhanced penalties for accounting and auditing improprieties at publicly traded companies and to protect investors by improving the accuracy and reliability of corporate disclosures pursuant to the securities laws. SOX and the SEC’s implementing regulations include provisions addressing, among other matters, the duties, functions and qualifications of audit committees for all public companies; certification of financial statements by the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer; the forfeiture of bonuses or other incentive-based compensation and profits from the sale of an issuer’s securities by directors and senior officers in the twelve month period following initial publication of any financial statements that later require restatement; disclosure of off-balance sheet transactions; a prohibition on personal loans to directors and officers, except (in the case of banking companies) loans in the normal course of business; expedited filing requirements for reports of beneficial ownership of company stock by insiders; disclosure of a code of ethics for senior officers, and of any change or waiver of such code; the formation of a public accounting oversight board; auditor independence; disclosure of fees paid to the company's auditors for non-audit services and limitations on the provision of such services; attestation requirements for company management and external auditors, relating to internal controls and procedures; and various increased criminal penalties for violations of federal securities laws.",section_1,94e5b5b3-cb61-4566-9310-5872d020c513

Management's report on internal control over financial reporting for 2019 is contained in Item 9A of this Report. The Company has incurred, and expects to continue to incur, costs in connection with its on-going compliance with Section 404.

Dividends. The Company derives funds for payment of dividends to its shareholders primarily from dividends received from its subsidiary, Community National Bank. Under the National Bank Act, prior approval from the OCC is required if the total of all dividends declared by a national bank in any calendar year will exceed the sum of such bank's net profits for that last year and its retained net profits for the preceding two calendar years, less any required transfers to surplus. Federal law also prohibits national banks from paying dividends greater than the bank's undivided profits after deducting statutory bad debt in excess of the bank's ALL.
The Company and the Bank are also subject to various general regulatory policies and requirements relating to the payment of dividends, including requirements to maintain adequate capital above regulatory minimums. The appropriate federal or state banking agency is authorized to determine under certain circumstances relating to the financial condition of a bank or bank holding company that the payment of dividends would be an unsafe or unsound practice and to prohibit such payment. In addition, under the Basel III capital requirements, failure to maintain the required capital conservation buffer would result in additional limitations on permissible shareholder distributions.",section_1,1cec3fb2-a8c1-4865-9dfe-b6905dbed4d7

The FRB has issued supervisory guidance on the payment of dividends and redemption and repurchases of stock by bank holding companies reflecting the expectation that a bank holding company will inform and consult with FRB supervisory staff in advance of declaring and paying any dividend that could raise safety and soundness concerns. Examples of actions that might raise such concerns include declaration of a dividend exceeding current period earnings; redeeming or repurchasing regulatory capital instruments when the bank holding company is experiencing financial weaknesses; or redeeming or repurchasing common stock or perpetual preferred stock that would result in a net reduction in the amount of such equity instruments outstanding compared with the beginning of the quarter in which the redemption or repurchase occurred. The guidance provides that a bank holding company should eliminate, defer or severely limit dividends if net income for the past four quarters is not sufficient to fully fund dividends; the prospective rate of earnings retention is not consistent with the holding company’s capital needs and overall current and prospective financial condition; or the holding company will not meet, or is in danger of not meeting, its minimum regulatory capital ratios.",section_1,b2a0a64d-d038-4eb8-b264-c94a922d3477

OCC Supervision. As a national banking association, the Bank is subject to the provisions of the National Bank Act and federal and state statutes and rules and regulations applicable to national banks. The primary supervisory authority for the Bank is the OCC. The Bank is subject to periodic examination by the OCC and must file periodic reports with the OCC containing a complete statement of its financial condition and results of operations. The OCC's examinations are designed for the protection of the Bank's depositors and not the Company’s shareholders.
The CFPB created by the Dodd-Frank Act took over responsibility for enforcing the principal federal consumer protection laws, such as the Truth in Lending Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act and the Truth in Saving Act, among others, in 2011. Institutions that have assets of $10 billion or less, such as our Bank subsidiary, will continue to be supervised and examined in this area by their primary federal regulators (in the case of our Bank subsidiary, the OCC). However, the Dodd-Frank Act gives the CFPB expanded data collecting powers for fair lending purposes for both small business and mortgage loans, as well as expanded authority to prevent unfair, deceptive and abusive practices.",section_1,dfb55812-81a0-4c2a-ad27-074e62d662a5

Prompt Corrective Action. The Bank is subject to regulatory capital requirements established under FDICIA. Among other things, FDICIA identifies five capital categories for insured depository institutions (well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized) and requires the respective U.S. federal regulatory agencies to implement systems for ""prompt corrective action"" for insured depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements within such categories. FDICIA imposes progressively more restrictive constraints on operations, management and capital distributions, depending on the category in which an institution is classified. Failure to meet the capital guidelines could also subject a banking institution to capital raising requirements. An ""undercapitalized"" bank must develop a capital restoration plan and its parent holding company must guarantee that bank's compliance with the plan. The liability of the parent holding company under any such guarantee is limited to the lessor of 5% of the bank's assets at the time it became undercapitalized or the amount needed to comply with the plan. Furthermore, in the event of the bankruptcy of the parent holding company, such guarantee would take priority over the parent's general unsecured creditors. In addition, FDICIA requires the various regulatory agencies to prescribe certain non-capital standards for safety and soundness related generally to operations and management, asset quality and executive compensation and permits regulatory action against a financial institution that does not meet such standards.",section_1,f0e34992-98d5-4c16-b598-c77f9428865b
718413,718413_2019.htm,2019,"and soundness related generally to operations and management, asset quality and executive compensation and permits regulatory action against a financial institution that does not meet such standards.
The federal bank regulatory agencies, including the OCC, have adopted substantially similar regulations that define the five capital categories identified by FDICIA. These regulations establish various degrees of corrective action to be taken when an FDIC-insured depository institution is considered undercapitalized. Effective January 1, 2015, the FDIC’s Prompt Corrective Action regulations were revised in accordance with the Basel III capital standards. The enhanced requirements (i) introduce a Common Equity Tier 1 ratio requirement at each capital category (other than critically undercapitalized), and set the required Common Equity Tier 1 ratio at 6.5% for well-capitalized status; (ii) increase the minimum Tier 1 capital ratio requirement for each category (other than critically undercapitalized), and set the minimum Tier 1 capital ratio for well-capitalized status at 8.0% (as compared to 6.0% under the prior rule); and (iii) eliminate the provision that permitted a bank with a composite supervisory rating of 1 to have a 3% leverage ratio and still be considered adequately capitalized. The Basel III capital standards do not change the total risk-based capital requirement for any prompt corrective action category.
As of December 31, 2019, the Bank was considered ""well capitalized"" under FDICIA’s Prompt Corrective Action capital requirements.

Deposit Insurance. The deposits of the Bank are insured by the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) of the FDIC up to the limits set forth under applicable law and are subject to the deposit insurance premium assessments of the DIF. The FDIC imposes a risk-based deposit premium assessments system, which was amended pursuant to the Federal Deposit Insurance Reform Act of 2005 and further amended by the Dodd-Frank Act. Under this system, as amended, the assessment rates for an insured depository institution vary according to the level of risk incurred in its activities. To arrive at an assessment rate for a banking institution, the FDIC places it in one of four risk categories determined by reference to its capital levels and supervisory ratings. In addition, in the case of those institutions in the lowest risk category, the FDIC further determines its assessment rate based on certain specified financial ratios or, if applicable, its long-term debt ratings. The assessment rate schedule can change from time to time, at the discretion of the FDIC, subject to certain limits. In addition, previously all FDIC insured depository institutions were required to pay a pro rata portion of the interest due on the obligations issued by the FICO to fund the closing and disposal of failed thrift institutions by the Resolution Trust Corporation. The FDIC discontinued collection of these payments in March 2019.",section_1,0d8a3b8d-f501-429a-bbb1-aaefd75eaa8c

The Dodd-Frank Act changed the assessment formula for determining deposit insurance premiums and modified certain insurance coverage provisions of the FDIA. The FDIC’s implementing rules, which redefined the base for FDIC insurance assessments from the amount of insured deposits to average consolidated total assets less average tangible equity, became effective April 1, 2011. Due to the “Small Bank Assessment Credit issued by the FDIC during the third quarter of 2019, the Bank’s total FDIC insurance assessment decreased for 2019 to $64,079 compared to $274,772 for 2018.

Brokered Deposits. Under FDICIA, an FDIC-insured bank is prohibited from accepting brokered deposits without prior approval of the FDIC unless it is well capitalized under the FDICIA's prompt corrective actions guidelines. The Company participates in the CDARS of the Promontory Interfinancial Network, which uses a deposit-matching engine to match CDARS deposits in other participating banks, dollar-for-dollar. This product, also known as reciprocal deposits, is designed to provide deposit insurance in excess of FDIC limits and thereby enhance customer attraction and retention, build deposits and improve net interest margins. Until recently reciprocal deposits were considered a form of brokered deposits, which are treated less favorably than other deposits for certain purposes; however, a provision of the 2018 Regulatory Relief Act provides that reciprocal deposits held by a well-capitalized and well managed bank are no longer classified as brokered deposits. CDARS also permits the “one-way” purchase of deposits, which the Company utilizes from time to time for liquidity management purposes. CDARS one-way deposits are considered brokered deposits for certain purposes under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and FDIC regulations. As of December 31, 2019 the Company had CDARS deposits totaling approximately $6.8 million in exchanged funds and $4.0 million in one-way funds. The Company also relies from time to time on purchased wholesale deposit funding, which is a form of brokered deposits. The Company had $7.1 million in purchased wholesale deposits outstanding at December 31, 2019. The Company’s Asset, Liability and Funds Management Policy limits the use of brokered deposits to 5% of total assets.",section_1,3b17e5c1-6515-405d-80d9-0f9474edc01e

USA Patriot Act. The USA PATRIOT Act is intended to strengthen the ability of U.S. law enforcement and the intelligence community to work cooperatively to combat terrorism on a variety of fronts. The Act contains extensive anti-money laundering and financial transparency provisions and imposes various requirements, including standards for verifying client identification at account opening, and rules to promote cooperation among financial institutions, regulators and law enforcement entities in identifying parties that may be involved in terrorism or money laundering. The Secretary of the Treasury and federal banking regulators have adopted several regulations to implement these provisions. The Act also amended the federal Bank Holding Company Act and the Bank Merger Act to require the federal banking regulatory authorities to consider the effectiveness of a bank holding company or a financial institution’s anti-money laundering activities when reviewing an application to expand operations.

These laws and regulations are designed to prevent the financial system from being used by criminals to hide illicit proceeds and to impede terrorists’ ability to access and move funds used in support of terrorist activities. Among other things, BSA/AML laws and regulations require financial institutions to establish AML programs that meet certain standards, including, in some instances, expanded reporting, particularly in the area of suspicious transactions, and enhanced information gathering and recordkeeping requirements. The Company maintains an AML program designed to ensure that it is in compliance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations related to AML and anti-terrorist financing initiatives. The AML program provides for a system of internal controls to ensure that appropriate due diligence and, when necessary, enhanced due diligence, including obtaining and maintaining appropriate documentation, is conducted at account opening and updated, as necessary, through the course of the client relationship. The AML program is also designed to ensure there are appropriate methods of monitoring transactions and account relationships to identify potentially suspicious activity and report suspicious activity to governmental authorities in accordance with applicable laws, rules and regulations. In addition, the AML program requires the training of appropriate personnel with regard to AML and anti-terrorist financing issues and provides for independent testing to ensure that the AML program is in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.

Financial Privacy. Under the federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Financial Modernization Act of 1999 all financial institutions, including the Company, are required to adopt privacy policies, restrict the sharing of nonpublic consumer customer data with nonaffiliated parties, and establish procedures and practices to protect customer data from unauthorized access. The Company is also subject to similar, but more stringent, requirements under state law, including the Vermont Financial Privacy Act. In addition, the Company is subject to the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act, including the amendments adopted in the federal Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003 (FACT Act). The FACT Act includes many provisions concerning national credit reporting standards and permits consumers to opt out of information sharing among affiliated companies for marketing purposes. It also requires financial institutions to notify their customers if they report negative information about them to a credit bureau or if they are granted credit terms less favorable than those generally available.

Qualified Mortgage Rules. Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFPB adopted significant amendments to the regulations that implement the Truth in Lending Act. These amendments, which became effective January 10, 2014, address mortgage origination practices by certain housing creditors, including the Bank, and generally require mortgage lenders to determine consumers’ ability to repay in one of two ways. The first alternative requires the mortgage lender to consider eight underwriting factors when making the credit decision. Alternatively, the mortgage lender can originate so-called qualified mortgages, or ""QMs"", which are entitled to a presumption that the creditor making the loan satisfied the ability-to-repay requirements. In general, a qualified mortgage is a residential mortgage loan that does not have certain high risk features, such as negative amortization, interest-only payments, balloon payments, or a term exceeding 30 years. In addition, to be a qualified mortgage, the points and fees paid by a consumer cannot exceed 3% of the total loan amount and the borrower’s total debt-to-income ratio must be no higher than 43% (subject to certain limited exceptions for loans eligible for purchase, guarantee or insurance by a government sponsored entity or a federal agency).",section_1,3ef82787-697f-4d88-b75b-81d34de44b0d

A lender originating a QM is protected against a legal claim that the lender failed to comply with the ability-to-repay requirement. A lender originating a mortgage that is not a QM is exposed to the risk of a potential claim that the lender did not comply with the ability-to-repay rules, which could require the lender to pay damages to the borrower, and could impair the lender’s ability to enforce the loan terms or foreclose on the real estate collateral. The ability-to-repay requirement creates a new basis for after-the-fact challenge of QM status by regulators and by consumers and its future interpretation by the courts may create substantial legal uncertainty. The CFPB’s mission is consumer protection, not lender safety and soundness, and for that reason the CFPB wrote the ability-to-repay rule with the goal of preventing consumers from being steered by lenders into expensive and unsustainable borrowing, rather than with the goal of assuring loan repayment. Accordingly, typical credit-quality features such as loan-to-value standards are not elements of the ability-to-repay rule, and it will not necessarily be the case that QMs have a higher probability or history of repayment than other mortgages.

Integrated TILA/RESPA (TRID) Disclosures. As required by the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFPB issued final rules in 2013 revising and integrating previously separate disclosures required under the RESPA and TILA in connection with certain closed-end consumer mortgage loans. These final rules became effective in October 2015 and require lenders to provide a new Loan Estimate (which combines content from the former Good Faith Estimate required under RESPA and the initial disclosures required under TILA) not later than the third business day after submission of a loan application, and a new Closing Disclosure (which combines content of the former HUD-1 Settlement Statement required under RESPA and the final disclosures required under TILA) at least three days prior to the loan closing. Other significant changes included in the TRID rules include: (1) expansion of the scope of loans that require RESPA early disclosures, including bridge loans, vacant land loans, and construction loans; (2) changes and additions to “waiting period” requirements to close a loan; (3) reduced tolerances for estimated fees and (4) the lender, rather than the closing agent, is responsible for providing final disclosures.

Community Reinvestment Act. The Federal CRA requires banks to define the communities they serve, identify the credit needs of those communities, collect and maintain data for each small business or small farm loan originated or purchased by the Bank, and maintain a Public File at each location. The federal banking regulators examine the institutions they regulate for compliance with the CRA and assign one of the following four ratings: “outstanding,” “satisfactory,” “needs to improve” or “substantial noncompliance”. The rating assigned reflects the bank’s record of helping to meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, consistent with the safe and sound operation of the bank. As of the Bank’s last CRA examination, completed during 2017, it received a rating of “Outstanding”.",section_1,0bfe449d-2221-4976-94f8-e74580658766

718413,718413_2019.htm,2019,"Home Mortgage Disclosure Act. The federal HMDA, which is implemented by CFPB’s Regulation C, requires mortgage lenders that maintain offices within MSAs to report and make available to the public specified information regarding their residential mortgage lending activities, such as the pricing of home mortgage loans, including the “rate spread” between the interest rate on loans and certain treasury securities and other benchmarks. The Bank became subject to HMDA reporting requirements as a result of its merger with LyndonBank in 2007, as the former LyndonBank branch in Enosburg Falls in Franklin County is included within the Burlington, Vermont MSA. In July 2015, the CFPB implemented and expanded new HMDA rules. The final rule adopts a dwelling-secured standard for all loans or lines of credit that are for personal, family, or household purposes. Thus, many consumer-purpose transactions, including closed-end home-equity loans, home-equity lines of credit, and reverse mortgages, are subject to the regulation. Most commercial-purpose transactions (i.e., loans or lines of credit not for personal, family, or household purposes) are subject to the regulation only if they are for the purpose of home purchase, home improvement, or refinancing. The final rule excludes from coverage home improvement loans that are not secured by a dwelling (i.e., home improvement loans that are unsecured or that are secured by some other type of collateral) and all agricultural-purpose loans and lines of credit.

Flood Insurance Reform. The Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2012 (Biggert-Waters Act), as amended by the Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act of 2014, modified the National Flood Insurance Program by: (i) increasing the maximum civil penalty for Flood Disaster Protection Act violations to $2,000 and eliminating the annual penalty cap; (ii) requiring certain lenders to escrow premiums and fees for flood insurance on residential improved real estate; (iii) directing lenders to accept private flood insurance and to notify borrowers of its availability; (iv) amending the force placement requirement provisions; and (v) permitting lenders to charge borrowers costs for lapses in or insufficient coverage. The civil penalty and force placed insurance provisions were effective immediately.
In July 2015, certain federal agencies issued a joint final rule exempting: (1) detached structures that are not used as a residence from the mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements and (2) HELOCs, business purpose loans, nonperforming loans, loans with terms of less than one year, loans for co-ops and condominiums, and subordinate loans on the same property from the mandatory escrow of flood insurance premium requirements. Additionally, the final rule requires certain lenders to escrow flood insurance payments and offer the option to escrow flood insurance premiums on residential improved real estate securing a loan, effective January 1, 2016. New rules effective July 1, 2019, require banks and other regulated financial institutions to accept certain private insurance policies in addition to National Flood Insurance Program policies.",section_1,94ec815c-b71c-49c2-98de-5f4b51e7a399

Reserve Requirements. FRB Regulation D requires all depository institutions to maintain reserves against their transaction accounts (generally, demand deposits, NOW accounts and certain other types of accounts that permit payments or transfers to third parties) and non-personal time deposits (generally, money market deposit accounts or other savings deposits held by corporations or other depositors that are not natural persons, and certain other types of time deposits), subject to certain exemptions. Because required reserves must be maintained in the form of either vault cash, a non-interest bearing account at the FRBB or a pass through account (as defined by the FRB), the effect of these reserve requirements is to reduce the amount of the Company's interest-bearing assets.
Federal Home Loan Bank System. The Bank is a member of the FHLB System, which consists of 12 regional Federal Home Loan Banks. The FHLB provides a central credit facility primarily for member institutions.

In 2009, the FRB issued comprehensive guidance on executive compensation policies, intended to ensure that the incentive compensation practices of banking organizations do not undermine their safety and soundness by encouraging excessive risk-taking. The guidance covers all employees that have the ability to affect materially an institution's risk profile, either individually or as part of a group, and establishes that incentive compensation arrangements should (1) provide incentives that do not encourage risk-taking beyond the institution's ability to identify and manage effectively; (2) be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management; and (3) be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by the board of directors. The guidance instructed institutions to begin an immediate review of their incentive compensation policies to ensure that they do not encourage excessive risk-taking and implement corrective programs as needed. Where deficiencies in incentive compensation arrangements exist, they must be immediately addressed. For institutions such as the Company that are not ""large, complex banking organizations"" as defined in the guidance, the FRB will review the incentive compensation arrangements as part of its regular, risk-focused examination process and not in a separate examination. These examinations will be tailored to the scope and complexity of the institution's activity and compensation arrangements. The findings will be included in the FRB's examination report and deficiencies will be incorporated into the institution's supervisory ratings.

Changes in interest rates could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Our results of operations depend substantially on our net interest income, which is the difference between the interest earned on loans, securities and other interest-earning assets and the interest paid on deposits and borrowings. These rates are highly sensitive to many factors beyond our control, including general economic conditions, inflation, recession, unemployment, money supply and the monetary policies of the FRB. If the interest rate we pay on deposits and other borrowings increases at a faster rate than the interest rate we earn on loans and other investments, our net interest income and therefore earnings, could be adversely affected. Conversely, our earnings could be adversely affected if the interest rate we earn on loans and other investments falls more quickly than the interest rate we pay on deposits and borrowings. While we have taken measures intended to manage the risks of operating in a changing interest rate environment, we cannot provide assurance that these measures will be effective in avoiding undue interest rate risk.",section_1A,e59732f4-bcbb-49d6-81cb-6743e0b170a4

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, in March 2020, the FRB lowered the target federal funds rate to 0% to 0.25%. It is unclear how long this historically low target federal funds rate will remain in effect. In a prolonged low interest rate environment, the difference between the total interest income earned on interest earning assets and the total interest expense incurred on interest bearing liabilities may compress, reducing our net interest income and adversely affecting our operating results. If short-term interest rates remain at their historically low levels for a prolonged period, and assuming longer term interest rates fall further, we could experience net interest margin compression as our interest earning assets would continue to re-price downward while our interest-bearing liability rates could fail to decline in tandem. Such an occurrence would have a material adverse effect on our net interest income and our results of operations.
Increases in interest rates also can affect the value of loans and other assets, such as investment securities, and may affect our ability to realize gains on the sale of assets. For example, we originate loans for sale to secondary market investors, and increasing interest rates may reduce the volume of loans originated for sale, resulting in a reduction in the fee income we earn on such sales. Further, increasing interest rates may adversely affect the ability of borrowers to pay the principal or interest on loans, resulting in an increase in our non-performing assets and a reduction in our income. At the same time, the marketability of the property securing a loan may be adversely affected by any reduced demand resulting from higher interest rates.",section_1A,74c57619-2808-48b5-9520-46a89be47683

In addition, increases in interest rates will increase the dividend rate on our Series A preferred stock, which is tied to the prime rate, and the interest rate on our debentures, which is tied to LIBOR. Furthermore, as discussed below, there is uncertainty as to our future interest costs on our subordinated debentures due to the scheduled phase out of LIBOR at the end of 2021. Higher preferred stock dividend payments and debenture interest costs would decrease the amount of funds available for payment of dividends on our common stock.

Our interest costs may increase as a result of the retirement of London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) as a reference rate for interest payments on our subordinated debentures.
In July 2017, the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) announced that LIBOR would no longer be published, with an expected target date of December 31, 2021 for the phase out. On March 5, 2021, the FCA announced firm target dates for the phase out of various LIBOR settings, including a phase out date of June 30, 2023 for 3-month LIBOR for U.S. dollar deposits. LIBOR is used extensively in the U.S and globally as a “benchmark” or “reference rate” for various commercial and financial contracts. In response, the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (“ARRC”), made up of financial and capital market institutions, was convened to address the replacement of LIBOR in the U.S. The ARRC identified a potential successor to LIBOR in the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) and crafted a plan to facilitate the transition. However, there are significant conceptual and technical differences between LIBOR and SOFR. The federal Financial Stability Oversight Committee has stated that the end or waning use of LIBOR has the potential to significantly disrupt trading in many important types of financial contracts.",section_1A,46515cf4-0a97-4cef-b6af-91cf1c659f0b

As of December 31, 2020, the Company had outstanding $12,887,000 in principal amount of Junior Subordinated Debentures due December 15, 2037, which bear a quarterly floating rate of interest equal to the 3-month LIBOR, plus 2.85%. Under the terms of the Indenture, if 3-month LIBOR is not available, the Trustee may obtain substitute quotations from four leading banks in the London interbank market for their offered rate to prime banks in the London market for U.S. dollar deposits having a three month maturity; if at least two such quotations are provided, the quarterly rate on the Debentures will be the arithmetic mean of such quotations. If fewer than two such quotations are received, the Trustee will request substitute quotations from four major New York City banks for their offered rate to leading European banks for loans in U.S. dollars; if at least two such quotations are provided, the quarterly rate on the Debentures will be the arithmetic mean of such quotations. The Debenture Trustee has not yet informed the Company as to how it intends to proceed. Phase out of LIBOR, including the Debenture Trustee’s implementation of the foregoing provisions, could significantly impact the Company’s interest costs on its Debentures and it is not possible to predict the magnitude of any such increase.
OPERATIONAL RISKS
As a participating lender in the SBA’s Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”), the Company is subject to additional risks that the SBA may not fund some or all PPP loan guaranties and risks of litigation from our customers or other parties regarding the processing of PPP loans.",section_1A,c289e2ee-76cb-414d-aa7f-e08ebb0ef5fe

We are a participating lender in the PPP, a loan program administered through the SBA, that was created to help eligible businesses, organizations and self-employed persons fund their operational costs during the COVID-19 pandemic. We originated $105.0 million in PPP loans during 2020, of which $64.3 million remained outstanding at December 31, 2020, and we continue to make new loans during 2021 under the PPP, as extended by the CAA. Under the PPP, the SBA guarantees 100% of the amounts loaned under the program. There is some ambiguity in the laws, rules and guidance regarding the operation of the PPP, which exposes us to risks relating to noncompliance with the PPP. In addition, some other financial institutions have experienced litigation related to their process and procedures used in processing applications for the PPP. Any financial liability, regulatory enforcement, litigation costs or reputational damage stemming from our participation in the PPP and any related litigation could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we may be exposed to credit risk on PPP loans if the SBA determines that there is a deficiency in the manner in which we originated, funded or serviced a PPP loan. If the SBA identifies a deficiency, the SBA may deny its liability under the guaranty for the affected loan or loans, reduce the amount of the guaranty, or, if it has already paid under the guaranty, seek recovery of any loss related to the deficiency.

We are subject to liquidity risk because we rely primarily on deposit-gathering to satisfy our funding needs.
Our primary source of liquidity is through the growth of deposits, which provide low cost funding for our operations. If we are unable to attract enough deposits in our market area to fund loan growth and our other funding needs, then we may be forced to purchase deposits or to borrow through the FHLBB or in the capital markets. Purchased deposits and borrowings would tend to be more expensive than funding through core deposits and therefore could have a negative impact on our results of operations, cash flow, liquidity and regulatory capital levels.
We are subject to credit risk and if our ALL is not adequate to cover actual losses, our earnings could decrease.
We are exposed to the risk that our borrowers may default on their obligations. A borrower’s default on its obligations under one or more loans may result in lost principal and interest income and increased operating expenses as a result of the allocation of management time and resources to the collection and work-out of the credit. In certain situations, where collection efforts are unsuccessful or acceptable work-out arrangements cannot be reached, we may have to write off the loan in whole or in part. In loan default situations, we may acquire real estate or other assets, if any, that secure the loan, through foreclosure or other similar available remedies, and the amount owed under the defaulted loan could exceed the value of the collateral acquired.",section_1A,3a8cdbef-d5ff-4329-97d8-58012cb6e65d

We periodically make a determination of the adequacy of our ALL based on available information, including, but not limited to, the quality of the loan portfolio as indicated by loan risk ratings, economic conditions, the value of the underlying collateral and the level of non-accruing and criticized loans. Management relies on its loan officers and credit quality reviews, its experience and its evaluation of economic conditions, among other factors, in determining the amount of the provision required for the allowance. Provisions to this allowance result in an expense for the period. If, as a result of general economic conditions, previously incorrect assumptions, an increase in defaulted loans, or other pertinent factors, we determine that additional increases in the ALL are necessary, additional expenses may be incurred. During 2020, in evaluating our ALL we downgraded certain qualitative factors and shortened our historical lookback period from five years to one year, in light of the adverse economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.",section_1A,527782d6-e8c3-4b39-9b84-cd0dd203de43

Determining the amount of the ALL inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires us to make significant estimates of current credit risks and trends, all of which may undergo material changes. At any time, we are likely to have loans in our portfolio that will result in losses but that have not been identified as nonperforming or potential problem credits. We cannot be certain that we will be able to identify deteriorating credits before they become nonperforming assets or that we will be able to limit or correctly estimate losses on those loans that are identified. The OCC, our subsidiary Bank’s primary federal regulator, reviews the loan portfolio from time to time as part of its regulatory examination and may request that we increase the ALL. Changes in economic conditions or individual business or personal circumstances affecting borrowers, new information regarding existing loans, identification of additional problem loans and other factors, both within and outside of our control, may require an increase in the allowance. In addition, if charge-offs in future periods exceed the ALL, we will need to make additional provisions to restore the allowance. Any provisions to increase or restore the ALL would decrease our net income and, possibly, our capital, and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. Under the new guidance, which will replace the existing incurred loss model for recognizing credit losses, banks and other lending institutions will be required to recognize the full amount of expected credit losses. The new guidance, which is referred to as the CECL model, requires that expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date that are accounted for at amortized cost be measured and recognized based on historical experience and current and reasonably supportable forecasted conditions to reflect the full amount of expected credit losses. Implementation of CECL could have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations and consolidated financial statements upon adoption as it may result in the recording of an increased ALL amount, with a related adverse impact on the calculation of the Company’s regulatory capital ratios. Adoption of the CECL model will become mandatory for the Company beginning with the 2023 fiscal year.

Prepayments of loans may negatively impact our business.
Generally, our customers may prepay the principal amount of their outstanding loans at any time. The speeds at which such prepayments occur, as well as the size of such prepayments, are within our customers’ discretion and may be affected by many factors beyond our control, including changes in prevailing interest rates. If customers prepay the principal amount of their loans, and we are unable to lend those funds to other borrowers or invest the funds at the same or higher interest rates, our interest income will be reduced. The prevailing low interest rates increase our prepayment risk. A significant reduction in interest income could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition.
Our loans and deposits are geographically concentrated and adverse local economic conditions could negatively affect our business.
Unlike many larger banking institutions, our banking operations are not geographically diversified. Substantially all of our loans, deposits and fee income are generated in northeastern and central Vermont. As a result, poor economic conditions in northeastern and central Vermont could adversely and significantly impact the demand for loans and our other financial products and services and may cause us to incur losses associated with higher default rates and decreased collateral values in our loan portfolio. Much of our market area is located in the poorest region of the state.

Our ability to pay dividends on our capital stock and to service our debt depends primarily on dividends from our subsidiary and may be subject to regulatory and contractual limitations.
As a holding company, our cash flow typically comes from dividends that our bank subsidiary, Community National Bank, pays to us. Therefore, our ability to pay dividends on our common and preferred stock and to service our subordinated debentures, depends on the dividends we receive from the Bank. Dividend payments from the Bank are subject to federal statutory and regulatory limitations, generally based on net profits and retained earnings and may be subject to additional prudential considerations, such as capital planning needs. In addition, FRB policy, which applies to us as a registered bank holding company, provides that dividends by bank holding companies should generally be paid out of current earnings looking back over a one-year period and should not be paid if regulatory capital levels are deemed insufficient. Further, regulatory capital requirements could curtail our ability to pay dividends in some cases if we do not maintain a required capital conservation buffer. Our failure to pay dividends on our common or preferred stock or our failure to service our debt could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. Moreover, if sufficient dividend funding from the Bank is not available to cover all our requirements, we would be obligated first to pay interest and, if applicable, principal on our debentures and then to pay dividends on our preferred stock before making any dividend payments on our common stock.
Although we have generally paid quarterly cash dividends on our common stock, we cannot provide any assurance that dividends will continue to be paid in the future or that the dividend rate will not be reduced in future periods.

The requirement to record certain assets and liabilities at fair value may adversely affect our financial results.
We report certain assets, including investment securities, at fair value. Generally, for assets that are reported at fair value we use quoted market prices or valuation models that utilize market data inputs to estimate fair value. Because we carry these assets on our books at their estimated fair value, we may incur losses even if the asset in question presents minimal credit risk. For example, we could be required to recognize OTTI in future periods with respect to investment securities in our portfolio. The amount and timing of any impairment recognized will depend on the severity and duration of the decline in fair value of our investment securities and our estimation of the anticipated recovery period.
Changes in accounting standards could materially affect our financial statements.
From time to time FASB and the SEC change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements and applicable disclosures in our SEC filings.

The capital rules require the Bank and the Company to maintain a 2.5% common equity Tier I capital conservation buffer above the minimum risk-based capital requirements for adequately capitalized institutions in order to avoid restrictions on the ability to pay dividends, discretionary bonuses, and to engage in share repurchases.

Under the 2018 Regulatory Relief Act, these capital requirements have been simplified for qualifying community banks and bank holding companies. In September 2019, the OCC and the other federal bank regulators approved a final joint rule that permits a qualifying community banking organization to opt in to a simplified regulatory capital framework. A qualifying institution that elects to utilize the simplified framework must maintain a CBLR in excess of 9%, and will thereby be deemed to have satisfied the generally applicable risk-based and other leverage capital requirements and (if applicable) the FDIC’s prompt corrective action framework. In order to utilize the CBLR framework, in addition to maintaining a CBLR of over 9%, a community banking organization must have less than $10 billion in total consolidated assets and must meet certain other criteria such as limitations on the amount of off-balance sheet exposures and on trading assets and liabilities.

When we acquire a business, a portion of the purchase price of the acquisition may be allocated to goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired determines the amount of the purchase price that is allocated to goodwill acquired. At December 31, 2020, our goodwill totaled approximately $11.6 million, created in connection with the LyndonBank acquisition in 2007. Under current accounting standards, if we determine goodwill is impaired, we would be required to write down the value of this asset to fair value. We conduct a review each year, or more frequently if events or circumstances warrant such, to determine whether goodwill is impaired. We last completed a goodwill impairment analysis as of December 31, 2020, and concluded goodwill was not impaired. We cannot provide assurance that we will not be required to take an impairment charge in the future.

The market price of our common stock may also be subject to fluctuations in response to numerous other factors, including the other factors discussed in this report, regardless of our actual operating performance. The possibility of such fluctuations occurring is increased due to the illiquid nature of the trading market in our common stock. Therefore, a shareholder may be unable to sell our common stock at or above the price at which it was purchased, or at or above the current market price or at the time of his or her choosing. This illiquid trading market also makes it particularly difficult for a shareholder to dispose of a large number of shares of our stock at desired pricing or on a desired timetable.
Our common stock is subordinate to our existing and future indebtedness and preferred stock.
Shares of our common stock are equity interests and do not constitute indebtedness. As such, our common stock ranks junior to all our customer deposits and other indebtedness, including our subordinated debentures, whether now existing or hereafter incurred, and other non-equity claims on us, with respect to assets available to satisfy claims. In addition, our common stock is junior in priority, including with respect to dividend and liquidation rights, to our outstanding shares of Series A Fixed-to-Floating Rate Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock. Further, the common stock will be subject to the prior liquidation rights of the holders of any debt we may issue in the future and may be subject to the prior dividend and liquidation rights of any series of preferred stock we may issue in the future.

Our organizational documents may have the effect of discouraging a third party from acquiring us.
Our Amended and Restated Articles of Association and By-Laws contain provisions, including a staggered board of directors and a supermajority vote requirement for certain acquisition transactions and other matters, that make it more difficult for a third party to gain control or acquire us without the consent of the board of directors. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and may make it more difficult for dissident shareholders to elect representatives as directors and take other corporate actions. To the extent that these provisions make these actions more difficult and make us a less attractive takeover candidate, they may not always be in our best interests or in the best interests of our shareholders, and in some circumstances may prevent holders of our common stock from receiving a takeover premium.

Channels for delivering financial products and services to our customers are evolving rapidly, with less reliance on traditional branch facilities and more use of online and mobile banking. We compete with larger providers that have significant resources to dedicate to improved technology and delivery channels. We periodically evaluate the profitability of our branch system and other office and operational facilities to improve efficiencies. However, identification and closure of unprofitable operations and facilities can lead to restructuring charges and introduce the risk of disruptions to revenues and customer relationships.
Substantial competition could adversely affect us.
Banking is a highly competitive business. We compete actively for loan, deposit, and other financial services business in northeastern and central Vermont. Our competitors include a number of state and national banks and tax-advantaged credit unions, as well as financial and nonfinancial firms that offer services similar to those that we offer. Some of our competitors are community or regional banks that have strong local market positions. Our large bank competitors, in particular, have substantial capital, technology and marketing resources that are well in excess of ours. These larger financial institutions may have greater access to capital at a lower cost and have a higher per-borrower lending limit than our Company, which may adversely affect our ability to compete with them effectively.",section_1A,907ec941-81da-4893-8ea9-77e0c9075838

In addition, technology and other changes increasingly allow parties to complete financial transactions electronically, without the need for a physical presence in a market area. We are therefore likely to face increasing competition from out-of-market competitors, including national firms. Moreover, in many cases transactions may now be completed without the involvement of banks. For example, consumers can pay bills and transfer funds over the Internet and by telephone without banks. Many non-bank financial service providers have lower overhead costs and are subject to fewer regulatory constraints. If consumers do not use banks to complete their financial transactions, we could potentially lose fee income, deposits and income generated from those deposits.
New products and services are essential to remain competitive but may subject us to additional risks.
We consistently attempt to offer new products and services to our customers to remain competitive. There can be risks and uncertainties associated with these new products and services especially if they are dependent on new technologies. We may spend significant time and resources in development of new products and services to market to customers. Through our development and implementation process we may incur risks associated with delivery timetables, pricing and profitability, compliance with regulations, technology failures and shifting customer preferences. Failure to successfully manage these risks could have a material effect on our financial condition, result of operations and business.

Changes in our tax rates could affect our future results.
Our future effective tax rates and tax liabilities could be unfavorably affected by increases in applicable tax rates and by other changes in federal or state tax laws, regulations and agency interpretations. Our effective tax rates could also be affected by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or by the outcomes of any examinations of our income tax returns by the IRS or our state income, franchise, sales and use or other tax returns by the Vermont Department of Taxes. Our results of operations and financial condition could also be adversely affected in the short-term by decreases in applicable tax rates that require us to revalue our deferred tax asset, as occurred in 2017 as a result of passage of the 2017 Tax Act.
Our business could suffer if we fail to attract and retain skilled personnel.
Our success depends, in large part, on our ability to attract and retain key personnel, including executives. Any of our current employees, including our senior management, may terminate their employment with us at any time. Competition for qualified personnel in our industry can be intense and our geographic market area might not be favorably perceived by potential executive management candidates. We may not be successful in attracting and retaining sufficient qualified personnel. We may also incur increased expenses and be required to divert the attention of other senior executives to recruit replacements for the loss of any key personnel.

Our common stock is included in the OTC QX market tier maintained by the OTC Markets Group, Inc. under the trading symbol CMTV, but is not traded on any securities exchange. Bid and ask quotations and trades in our stock made by certain brokerage firms are reported through the OTC Link® Alternative Trading System (ATS) maintained by a subsidiary of the OTC Markets Group, Inc. However, trading in our stock is sporadic. A public trading market for a particular class of stock having the desired characteristics of depth, liquidity and orderliness depends on the presence in the marketplace of numerous buyers and sellers of that stock at any given time, which in turn depends on the individual decisions of investors and general economic and market conditions over which issuers have no control. The trading market in our stock does not exhibit these characteristics. The trading history of our common stock has been characterized by relatively low trading volume.

Our ability to pay dividends on our capital stock and to service our debt depends primarily on dividends from our subsidiary and may be subject to regulatory and contractual limitations.
As a holding company, our cash flow typically comes from dividends that our bank subsidiary, Community National Bank, pays to us. Therefore, our ability to pay dividends on our common and preferred stock and to service our subordinated debentures, depends on the dividends we receive from the Bank. Dividend payments from the Bank are subject to federal statutory and regulatory limitations, generally based on net profits and retained earnings and may be subject to additional prudential considerations, such as capital planning needs. In addition, FRB policy, which applies to us as a registered bank holding company, provides that dividends by bank holding companies should generally be paid out of current earnings looking back over a one-year period and should not be paid if regulatory capital levels are deemed insufficient. Further, regulatory capital requirements could curtail our ability to pay dividends in some cases if we do not maintain a required capital conservation buffer. Our failure to pay dividends on our common or preferred stock or our failure to service our debt could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. Moreover, if sufficient dividend funding from the Bank is not available to cover all our requirements, we would be obligated first to pay interest and, if applicable, principal on our debentures and then to pay dividends on our preferred stock before making any dividend payments on our common stock.",section_1A,e6cf06e6-684a-4f0b-96b4-22eb83b03d6f

Although we have generally paid quarterly cash dividends on our common stock, we cannot provide any assurance that dividends will continue to be paid in the future or that the dividend rate will not be reduced in future periods.
Securities issued by us, including our common stock, are not FDIC insured.

Changes in interest rates could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Our results of operations depend substantially on our net interest income, which is the difference between the interest earned on loans, securities and other interest-earning assets and the interest paid on deposits and borrowings. These rates are highly sensitive to many factors beyond our control, including general economic conditions, inflation, recession, unemployment, money supply and the monetary policies of the FRB. If the interest rate we pay on deposits and other borrowings increases at a faster rate than the interest rate we earn on loans and other investments, our net interest income and therefore earnings, could be adversely affected. Conversely, our earnings could be adversely affected if the interest rate we earn on loans and other investments falls more quickly than the interest rate we pay on deposits and borrowings. While we have taken measures intended to manage the risks of operating in a changing interest rate environment, we cannot provide assurance that these measures will be effective in avoiding undue interest rate risk.",section_1A,2a07feda-73bd-4c61-8770-8859ad505a07

Increases in interest rates also can affect the value of loans and other assets, such as investment securities, and may affect our ability to realize gains on the sale of assets. For example, we originate loans for sale to secondary market investors, and increasing interest rates may reduce the volume of loans originated for sale, resulting in a reduction in the fee income we earn on such sales. Further, increasing interest rates may adversely affect the ability of borrowers to pay the principal or interest on loans, resulting in an increase in our non-performing assets and a reduction in our income.
In addition, increases in interest rates will increase the dividend rate on our Series A preferred stock, which is tied to the prime rate, and the interest rate on our debentures, which is tied to LIBOR. Furthermore, there is uncertainty about the continued availability of LIBOR beyond 2021, due to changes proposed by the United Kingdom regulatory entity that regulates LIBOR. Higher preferred stock dividend payments and debenture interest costs would decrease the amount of funds available for payment of dividends on our common stock.

We are subject to liquidity risk because we rely primarily on deposit-gathering to satisfy our funding needs.
Our primary source of liquidity is through the growth of deposits, which provide low cost funding for our operations. If we are unable to attract enough deposits in our market area to fund loan growth and our other funding needs, then we may be forced to purchase deposits or to borrow through the FHLBB or in the capital markets. Purchased deposits and borrowings would tend to be more expensive than funding through core deposits and therefore could have a negative impact on our results of operations, cash flow, liquidity and regulatory capital levels.
We are subject to credit risk and if our ALL is not adequate to cover actual losses, our earnings could decrease.
We are exposed to the risk that our borrowers may default on their obligations. A borrower's default on its obligations under one or more loans may result in lost principal and interest income and increased operating expenses as a result of the allocation of management time and resources to the collection and work-out of the credit. In certain situations, where collection efforts are unsuccessful or acceptable work-out arrangements cannot be reached, we may have to write off the loan in whole or in part. In loan default situations, we may acquire real estate or other assets, if any, that secure the loan, through foreclosure or other similar available remedies, and the amount owed under the defaulted loan could exceed the value of the collateral acquired.",section_1A,701685f7-f093-4758-8559-40bb46a4633c

We periodically make a determination of the adequacy of our ALL based on available information, including, but not limited to, the quality of the loan portfolio as indicated by loan risk ratings, economic conditions, the value of the underlying collateral and the level of non-accruing and criticized loans. Management relies on its loan officers and credit quality reviews, its experience and its evaluation of economic conditions, among other factors, in determining the amount of the provision required for the allowance.

At any time, we are likely to have loans in our portfolio that will result in losses but that have not been identified as nonperforming or potential problem credits. We cannot be certain that we will be able to identify deteriorating credits before they become nonperforming assets or that we will be able to limit or correctly estimate losses on those loans that are identified. The OCC, our subsidiary Bank’s primary federal regulator, reviews the loan portfolio from time to time as part of its regulatory examination and may request that we increase the ALL. Changes in economic conditions or individual business or personal circumstances affecting borrowers, new information regarding existing loans, identification of additional problem loans and other factors, both within and outside of our control, may require an increase in the allowance. In addition, if charge-offs in future periods exceed the ALL, we will need to make additional provisions to restore the allowance. Any provisions to increase or restore the ALL would decrease our net income and, possibly, our capital, and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.",section_1A,b2478629-4514-46ba-a841-ca3e574f9c69

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. Under the new guidance, which will replace the existing incurred loss model for recognizing credit losses, banks and other lending institutions will be required to recognize the full amount of expected credit losses. The new guidance, which is referred to as the CECL model, requires that expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date that are accounted for at amortized cost be measured and recognized based on historical experience and current and reasonably supportable forecasted conditions to reflect the full amount of expected credit losses. Implementation of CECL could have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations and consolidated financial statements upon adoption as it may result in the recording of an increased ALL amount, with a related adverse impact on the calculation of the Company’s regulatory capital ratios.

Prepayments of loans may negatively impact our business.
Generally, our customers may prepay the principal amount of their outstanding loans at any time. The speeds at which such prepayments occur, as well as the size of such prepayments, are within our customers’ discretion and may be affected by many factors beyond our control, including changes in prevailing interest rates. If customers prepay the principal amount of their loans, and we are unable to lend those funds to other borrowers or invest the funds at the same or higher interest rates, our interest income will be reduced. A significant reduction in interest income could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition.
Our loans and deposits are geographically concentrated and adverse local economic conditions could negatively affect our business.
Unlike many larger banking institutions, our banking operations are not geographically diversified. Substantially all of our loans, deposits and fee income are generated in northeastern and central Vermont. As a result, poor economic conditions in northeastern and central Vermont could adversely impact the demand for loans and our other financial products and services and may cause us to incur losses associated with higher default rates and decreased collateral values in our loan portfolio. Much of our market area is located in the poorest region of the state. Economic conditions in northeastern and central Vermont are subject to various uncertainties, to a greater degree than other regions of the state. If economic conditions in our market area decline, we expect that our level of problem assets would increase and our prospects for growth would be impaired.

Generally, for assets that are reported at fair value we use quoted market prices or valuation models that utilize market data inputs to estimate fair value. Because we carry these assets on our books at their estimated fair value, we may incur losses even if the asset in question presents minimal credit risk. For example, we could be required to recognize OTTI in future periods with respect to investment securities in our portfolio.

There can be risks and uncertainties associated with these new products and services especially if they are dependent on new technologies. We may spend significant time and resources in development of new products and services to market to customers. Through our development and implementation process we may incur risks associated with delivery timetables, pricing and profitability, compliance with regulations, technology failures and shifting customer preferences. Failure to successfully manage these risks could have a material effect on our financial condition, result of operations and business.

Changes in accounting standards could materially affect our financial statements.
From time to time FASB and the SEC change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements and applicable disclosures in our SEC filings. These changes can be very difficult to predict and can materially affect how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in our restating prior period financial statements. Implementation of accounting changes, with associated professional consultation and advice, can be costly, even if the change will not have any material effect on our financial statements.
Our internal controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented.
Management periodically reviews and updates our internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance policies and procedures. However, any system of controls, no matter how well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system are met.

Our future effective tax rates and tax liabilities could be unfavorably affected by increases in applicable tax rates and by other changes in federal or state tax laws, regulations and agency interpretations. Our effective tax rates could also be affected by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or by the outcomes of any examinations of our income tax returns by the IRS or our state income, franchise, sales and use or other tax returns by the Vermont Department of Taxes. Our results of operations and financial condition could also be adversely affected in the short-term by decreases in applicable tax rates that require us to revalue our deferred tax asset, as occurred in 2017 as a result of passage of the 2017 Tax Act.
Our business could suffer if we fail to attract and retain skilled personnel.
Our success depends, in large part, on our ability to attract and retain key personnel, including executives. Any of our current employees, including our senior management, may terminate their employment with us at any time. Competition for qualified personnel in our industry can be intense and our geographic market area might not be favorably perceived by potential executive management candidates. We may not be successful in attracting and retaining sufficient qualified personnel. We may also incur increased expenses and be required to divert the attention of other senior executives to recruit replacements for the loss of any key personnel.

In this event, we might be required to remedy these violations at the affected properties at our sole cost and expense. The cost of remedial action could substantially exceed the value of affected properties.

We have become subject to more stringent capital requirements.
As of January 1, 2015, we were required to comply with new capital rules issued by the federal banking agencies that implemented the Basel III capital standards and established the minimum capital levels required under the Dodd-Frank Act. These new capital rules require banks and bank holding companies to maintain a minimum common equity Tier I capital ratio of 4.5% of risk-weighted assets, a minimum Tier I capital ratio of 6.0% of risk-weighted assets, a minimum total capital ratio of 8.0% of risk-weighted assets, and a minimum leverage ratio of 4.0%. Subject to a transition period, the new capital rules require banks and bank holding companies to maintain a 2.5% common equity Tier I capital conservation buffer above the minimum risk-based capital requirements for adequately capitalized institutions to avoid restrictions on the ability to pay dividends, discretionary bonuses, and to engage in share repurchases. The Company and the Bank met these requirements as of December 31, 2018. The new rules permanently grandfathered trust preferred securities issued before May 19, 2010 for institutions with less than $15.0 billion in total assets as of December 31, 2009, subject to a limit of 25% of Tier I capital. Our trust preferred securities qualify for this grandfather treatment. The new rules increased the required capital for certain categories of assets, including high volatility construction real estate loans and certain exposures related to securitizations, but retained the previous capital treatment of residential mortgages. Under the new rules, we were permitted to make, and did make, a one-time, permanent election to continue to exclude accumulated other comprehensive income from capital.",section_1A,75b00a8d-1a4b-4f50-aa47-bb7c5c849720

Continued implementation of these standards, or any other new regulations, may adversely affect our ability to pay dividends, or require us to reduce business levels or raise capital, including in ways that may adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.
While the 2018 Regulatory Relief Act provides limited relief from some of the requirements of Basel III for qualifying community banks by creating a single capital ratio, the CBLR, the banking agencies have not yet adopted final implementing rules and we are therefore unable to predict with certainty whether the Company will be able to satisfy the CBLR requirement upon its adoption by the agencies.

We may be required to write down goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets.
When we acquire a business, a portion of the purchase price of the acquisition may be allocated to goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired determines the amount of the purchase price that is allocated to goodwill acquired. At December 31, 2018, our goodwill totaled approximately $11.6 million, created in connection with the LyndonBank acquisition in 2007. Under current accounting standards, if we determine goodwill is impaired, we would be required to write down the value of these assets to fair value. We conduct a review each year, or more frequently if events or circumstances warrant such, to determine whether goodwill is impaired. We last completed a goodwill impairment analysis as of December 31, 2018, and concluded goodwill was not impaired. We cannot provide assurance that we will not be required to take an impairment charge in the future. Any impairment charge would have a negative effect on our shareholders’ equity and financial results and may cause a decline in our stock price.

Our common stock is included in the OTC QX market tier maintained by the OTC Markets Group, Inc. under the trading symbol CMTV, but is not traded on any securities exchange. Bid and ask quotations and trades in our stock made by certain brokerage firms are reported through the OTC Link® Alternative Trading System (ATS) maintained by a subsidiary of the OTC Markets Group, Inc. However, trading in our stock is sporadic. A public trading market for a particular class of stock having the desired characteristics of depth, liquidity and orderliness depends on the presence in the marketplace of numerous buyers and sellers of that stock at any given time, which in turn depends on the individual decisions of investors and general economic and market conditions over which issuers have no control. The trading market in our stock does not exhibit these characteristics. The trading history of our common stock has been characterized by relatively low trading volume. This lack of an active public market means that the value of a shareholder’s investment in our common stock may be subject to sudden fluctuations, as individual trades have a greater effect on our reported trading price than would be the case in a broad public market with significant daily trading volume.
The market price of our common stock may also be subject to fluctuations in response to numerous other factors, including the factors discussed below, regardless of our actual operating performance. The possibility of such fluctuations occurring is increased due to the illiquid nature of the trading market in our common stock. Therefore, a shareholder may be unable to sell our common stock at or above the price at which it was purchased, or at or above the current market price or at the time of his or her choosing.",section_1A,1a1da293-bfe3-4530-9509-f0058bd48c24

Our ability to pay dividends on our capital stock and to service our debt depends primarily on dividends from our subsidiary and may be subject to regulatory and contractual limitations.
As a holding company, our cash flow typically comes from dividends that our bank subsidiary, Community National Bank, pays to us. Therefore, our ability to pay dividends on our common and preferred stock and to service our subordinated debentures, depends on the dividends we receive from the Bank. Dividend payments from the Bank are subject to federal statutory and regulatory limitations, generally based on net profits and retained earnings and may be subject to additional prudential considerations, such as capital planning needs. In addition, FRB policy, which applies to us as a registered bank holding company, provides that dividends by bank holding companies should generally be paid out of current earnings looking back over a one-year period and should not be paid if regulatory capital levels are deemed insufficient. Further, regulatory capital requirements could curtail our ability to pay dividends in some cases if we do not maintain a required capital conservation buffer. Our failure to pay dividends on our common or preferred stock or our failure to service our debt could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock. Moreover, if sufficient dividend funding from the Bank is not available to cover all our requirements, we would be obligated first to pay interest and, if applicable, principal on our debentures and then to pay dividends on our preferred stock before making any dividend payments on our common stock.",section_1A,90a1f399-677a-48fc-8dc5-e7f22203e7bb

Although we have generally paid quarterly cash dividends on our common stock, we cannot provide any assurance that dividends will continue to be paid in the future or that the dividend rate will not be reduced in future periods.
Our common stock is subordinate to our existing and future indebtedness and preferred stock.
Shares of our common stock are equity interests and do not constitute indebtedness. As such, our common stock ranks junior to all our customer deposits and indebtedness, whether now existing or hereafter incurred, and other non-equity claims on us, with respect to assets available to satisfy claims. In addition, our common stock is junior in priority, including with respect to dividend and liquidation rights, to our outstanding shares of Series A Fixed-to-Floating Rate Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock. Further, the common stock will be subject to the prior liquidation rights of the holders of any debt we may issue in the future and may be subject to the prior dividend and liquidation rights of any series of preferred stock we may issue in the future.
Securities issued by us, including our common stock, are not FDIC insured.

Changes in interest rates could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.
Our results of operations depend substantially on our net interest income, which is the difference between the interest earned on loans, securities and other interest-earning assets and the interest paid on deposits and borrowings. These rates are highly sensitive to many factors beyond our control, including general economic conditions, inflation, recession, unemployment, money supply and the monetary policies of the FRB. If the interest rate we pay on deposits and other borrowings increases at a faster rate than the interest rate we earn on loans and other investments, our net interest income and therefore earnings, could be adversely affected. Conversely, our earnings could be adversely affected if the interest rate we earn on loans and other investments falls more quickly than the interest rate we pay on deposits and borrowings. While we have taken measures intended to manage the risks of operating in a changing interest rate environment, we cannot provide assurance that these measures will be effective in avoiding undue interest rate risk.
Increases in interest rates also can affect the value of loans and other assets, such as investment securities, and may affect our ability to realize gains on the sale of assets. For example, we originate loans for sale to secondary market investors, and increasing interest rates may reduce the volume of loans originated for sale, resulting in a reduction in the fee income we earn on such sales. Further, increasing interest rates may adversely affect the ability of borrowers to pay the principal or interest on loans, resulting in an increase in our non-performing assets and a reduction in our income.",section_1A,536cae5a-c4de-4c75-ad0d-6f2f8dca5dd8

In addition, increases in interest rates will increase the dividend rate on our Series A preferred stock, which is tied to the prime rate, and the interest rate on our debentures, which is tied to LIBOR. Furthermore, there is uncertainty about the continued availability of LIBOR beyond 2021, due to changes proposed by the United Kingdom regulatory entity that regulates LIBOR. Higher preferred stock dividend payments and debenture interest costs would decrease the amount of funds available for payment of dividends on our common stock.
We may be impacted by the retirement of London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) as a reference rate.
In July 2017, the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority announced that LIBOR may no longer be published after 2021. LIBOR is used extensively in the U.S and globally as a “benchmark” or “reference rate” for various commercial and financial contracts. In response, the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (“ARRC”), made up of financial and capital market institutions, was convened to address the replacement of LIBOR in the U.S. The ARRC identified a potential successor to LIBOR in the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) and crafted a plan to facilitate the transition. However, there are significant conceptual and technical differences between LIBOR and SOFR. The federal Financial Stability Oversight Committee has stated that the end or waning use of LIBOR has the potential to significantly disrupt trading in many important types of financial contracts.",section_1A,1d75d80a-fce2-4dca-8dfc-78cd37b176e3

As of December 31, 2019, the Company had outstanding $12,887,000 in principal amount of Junior Subordinated Debentures due December 15, 2037, which bear a quarterly floating rate of interest equal to the 3-month LIBOR, plus 2.85%. The Company has reviewed the pertinent language in the Indenture governing the Debentures and believes that the Debenture Trustee has sufficient authority under the Indenture to establish a substitute interest rate benchmark independent of any action or recommendation of the ARRC, and without the need to amend the Indenture. Under the terms of the Indenture, if 3-month LIBOR is not available, the Trustee may obtain substitute quotations from four leading banks in the London interbank market for their offered rate to prime banks in the London market for U.S. dollar deposits having a three month maturity; if at least two such quotations are provided, the quarterly rate on the Debentures will be the arithmetic mean of such quotations. If fewer than two such quotations are received, the Trustee will request substitute quotations from four major New York City banks for their offered rate to leading European banks for loans in U.S. dollars; if at least two such quotations are provided, the quarterly rate on the Debentures will be the arithmetic mean of such quotations. The Debenture Trustee has not yet informed the Company as to how it intends to proceed. Phase out of LIBOR could significantly impact the Company’s interest costs on its Debentures.

Our primary source of liquidity is through the growth of deposits, which provide low cost funding for our operations. If we are unable to attract enough deposits in our market area to fund loan growth and our other funding needs, then we may be forced to purchase deposits or to borrow through the FHLBB or in the capital markets. Purchased deposits and borrowings would tend to be more expensive than funding through core deposits and therefore could have a negative impact on our results of operations, cash flow, liquidity and regulatory capital levels.
We are subject to credit risk and if our ALL is not adequate to cover actual losses, our earnings could decrease.
We are exposed to the risk that our borrowers may default on their obligations. A borrower's default on its obligations under one or more loans may result in lost principal and interest income and increased operating expenses as a result of the allocation of management time and resources to the collection and work-out of the credit. In certain situations, where collection efforts are unsuccessful or acceptable work-out arrangements cannot be reached, we may have to write off the loan in whole or in part. In loan default situations, we may acquire real estate or other assets, if any, that secure the loan, through foreclosure or other similar available remedies, and the amount owed under the defaulted loan could exceed the value of the collateral acquired.",section_1A,31320454-249f-4937-8209-763235c23525

We periodically make a determination of the adequacy of our ALL based on available information, including, but not limited to, the quality of the loan portfolio as indicated by loan risk ratings, economic conditions, the value of the underlying collateral and the level of non-accruing and criticized loans. Management relies on its loan officers and credit quality reviews, its experience and its evaluation of economic conditions, among other factors, in determining the amount of the provision required for the allowance. Provisions to this allowance result in an expense for the period. If, as a result of general economic conditions, previously incorrect assumptions, an increase in defaulted loans, or other pertinent factors, we determine that additional increases in the ALL are necessary, additional expenses may be incurred.",section_1A,e1493188-17c5-46b6-9b25-747edf8edde5

Determining the amount of the ALL inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires us to make significant estimates of current credit risks and trends, all of which may undergo material changes. At any time, we are likely to have loans in our portfolio that will result in losses but that have not been identified as nonperforming or potential problem credits. We cannot be certain that we will be able to identify deteriorating credits before they become nonperforming assets or that we will be able to limit or correctly estimate losses on those loans that are identified. The OCC, our subsidiary Bank’s primary federal regulator, reviews the loan portfolio from time to time as part of its regulatory examination and may request that we increase the ALL. Changes in economic conditions or individual business or personal circumstances affecting borrowers, new information regarding existing loans, identification of additional problem loans and other factors, both within and outside of our control, may require an increase in the allowance. In addition, if charge-offs in future periods exceed the ALL, we will need to make additional provisions to restore the allowance. Any provisions to increase or restore the ALL would decrease our net income and, possibly, our capital, and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.",section_1A,7702c1f1-f482-48ba-b52a-118381dc4726

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. Under the new guidance, which will replace the existing incurred loss model for recognizing credit losses, banks and other lending institutions will be required to recognize the full amount of expected credit losses. The new guidance, which is referred to as the CECL model, requires that expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date that are accounted for at amortized cost be measured and recognized based on historical experience and current and reasonably supportable forecasted conditions to reflect the full amount of expected credit losses. Implementation of CECL could have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations and consolidated financial statements upon adoption as it may result in the recording of an increased ALL amount, with a related adverse impact on the calculation of the Company’s regulatory capital ratios.

Prepayments of loans may negatively impact our business.
Generally, our customers may prepay the principal amount of their outstanding loans at any time. The speeds at which such prepayments occur, as well as the size of such prepayments, are within our customers’ discretion and may be affected by many factors beyond our control, including changes in prevailing interest rates. If customers prepay the principal amount of their loans, and we are unable to lend those funds to other borrowers or invest the funds at the same or higher interest rates, our interest income will be reduced. A significant reduction in interest income could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition.
Our loans and deposits are geographically concentrated and adverse local economic conditions could negatively affect our business.
Unlike many larger banking institutions, our banking operations are not geographically diversified. Substantially all of our loans, deposits and fee income are generated in northeastern and central Vermont. As a result, poor economic conditions in northeastern and central Vermont could adversely impact the demand for loans and our other financial products and services and may cause us to incur losses associated with higher default rates and decreased collateral values in our loan portfolio. Much of our market area is located in the poorest region of the state. Economic conditions in northeastern and central Vermont are subject to various uncertainties, to a greater degree than other regions of the state.

Generally, for assets that are reported at fair value we use quoted market prices or valuation models that utilize market data inputs to estimate fair value. Because we carry these assets on our books at their estimated fair value, we may incur losses even if the asset in question presents minimal credit risk. For example, we could be required to recognize OTTI in future periods with respect to investment securities in our portfolio. The amount and timing of any impairment recognized will depend on the severity and duration of the decline in fair value of our investment securities and our estimation of the anticipated recovery period.
Market changes in delivery of financial services may adversely affect demand for our services.
Channels for delivering financial products and services to our customers are evolving rapidly, with less reliance on traditional branch facilities and more use of online and mobile banking. We compete with larger providers that have significant resources to dedicate to improved technology and delivery channels. We periodically evaluate the profitability of our branch system and other office and operational facilities to improve efficiencies. However, identification and closure of unprofitable operations and facilities can lead to restructuring charges and introduce the risk of disruptions to revenues and customer relationships.
Substantial competition could adversely affect us.",section_1A,e79c00ff-6262-42f2-bf3d-78cff866c08f

Substantial competition could adversely affect us.
Banking is a highly competitive business. We compete actively for loan, deposit, and other financial services business in northeastern and central Vermont. Our competitors include a number of state and national banks and tax-advantaged credit unions, as well as financial and nonfinancial firms that offer services similar to those that we offer. Some of our competitors are community or regional banks that have strong local market positions. Our large bank competitors, in particular, have substantial capital, technology and marketing resources that are well in excess of ours. These larger financial institutions may have greater access to capital at a lower cost and have a higher per-borrower lending limit than our Company, which may adversely affect our ability to compete with them effectively.
In addition, technology and other changes increasingly allow parties to complete financial transactions electronically, without the need for a physical presence in a market area. We are therefore likely to face increasing competition from out-of-market competitors, including national firms. Moreover, in many cases transactions may now be completed without the involvement of banks. For example, consumers can pay bills and transfer funds over the Internet and by telephone without banks. Many non-bank financial service providers have lower overhead costs and are subject to fewer regulatory constraints. If consumers do not use banks to complete their financial transactions, we could potentially lose fee income, deposits and income generated from those deposits.

These risks include, but are not limited to, data processing system failures and errors, inadequate or failed internal processes, customer or employee fraud, cyberattacks and catastrophic failures resulting from terrorist acts or natural disasters. Despite the safeguards we maintain, we cannot be certain that all of our systems are entirely free from vulnerability to attack or other technological difficulties or failures.

We depend on the accuracy and completeness of information about customers and counterparties.
In deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions with customers and counterparties, we may rely on information furnished by or on behalf of customers and counterparties, including financial statements and other financial information. We also may rely on representations of clients and counterparties as to the accuracy and completeness of that information and, with respect to financial statements, on reports of independent auditors if made available. If this information is inaccurate, we may suffer financial or reputational harm or other adverse effects with respect to the operation of our business, our financial condition and our results of operations.
New products and services are essential to remain competitive but may subject us to additional risks.
We consistently attempt to offer new products and services to our customers to remain competitive. There can be risks and uncertainties associated with these new products and services especially if they are dependent on new technologies. We may spend significant time and resources in development of new products and services to market to customers. Through our development and implementation process we may incur risks associated with delivery timetables, pricing and profitability, compliance with regulations, technology failures and shifting customer preferences.

Changes in accounting standards could materially affect our financial statements.
From time to time FASB and the SEC change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements and applicable disclosures in our SEC filings. These changes can be very difficult to predict and can materially affect how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in our restating prior period financial statements.

Our future effective tax rates and tax liabilities could be unfavorably affected by increases in applicable tax rates and by other changes in federal or state tax laws, regulations and agency interpretations. Our effective tax rates could also be affected by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or by the outcomes of any examinations of our income tax returns by the IRS or our state income, franchise, sales and use or other tax returns by the Vermont Department of Taxes.

Any of our current employees, including our senior management, may terminate their employment with us at any time. Competition for qualified personnel in our industry can be intense and our geographic market area might not be favorably perceived by potential executive management candidates.

In this event, we might be required to remedy these violations at the affected properties at our sole cost and expense. The cost of remedial action could substantially exceed the value of affected properties. We may not have adequate remedies against the prior owner or other responsible parties and could find it difficult or impossible to sell the affected properties.

718413,718413_2019.htm,2019,"on our results of operations and financial condition.
We are subject to detailed capital requirements and cannot ensure that we will qualify for simplified capital calculations in any future period.
As of January 1, 2015, we were required to comply with new capital rules issued by the federal banking agencies that implemented the Basel III capital standards and established the minimum capital levels required under the Dodd-Frank Act. These new capital rules require banks and bank holding companies to maintain a minimum common equity Tier I capital ratio of 4.5% of risk-weighted assets, a minimum Tier I capital ratio of 6.0% of risk-weighted assets, a minimum total capital ratio of 8.0% of risk-weighted assets, and a minimum leverage ratio of 4.0%. Subject to a transition period, the new capital rules require banks and bank holding companies to maintain a 2.5% common equity Tier I capital conservation buffer above the minimum risk-based capital requirements for adequately capitalized institutions to avoid restrictions on the ability to pay dividends, discretionary bonuses, and to engage in share repurchases. The Company and the Bank met these requirements as of December 31, 2019. The new rules permanently grandfathered trust preferred securities issued before May 19, 2010 for institutions with less than $15.0 billion in total assets as of December 31, 2009, subject to a limit of 25% of Tier I capital. Our trust preferred securities qualify for this grandfather treatment. The new rules increased the required capital for certain categories of assets, including high volatility construction real estate loans and certain exposures related to securitizations, but retained the previous capital treatment of residential mortgages. Under the new rules, we were permitted to make, and did make, a one-time, permanent election to continue to exclude accumulated other comprehensive income from capital.",section_1A,23280f9f-771e-488d-a888-4b920cb8a926

These standards could adversely affect our ability to pay dividends, or require us to reduce business levels or raise capital, including in ways that may adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.
Under the 2018 Regulatory Relief Act, these capital requirements have been simplified for qualifying community banks and bank holding companies. In September 2019, the OCC and the other federal bank regulators approved a final joint rule that permits a qualifying community banking organization to opt in to a simplified regulatory capital framework. A qualifying institution that elects to utilize the simplified framework must maintain a CBLR in excess of 9%, and will thereby be deemed to have satisfied the generally applicable risk-based and other leverage capital requirements and (if applicable) the FDIC’s prompt corrective action framework. In order to utilize the CBLR framework, in addition to maintaining a CBLR of over 9%, a community banking organization must have less than $10 billion in total consolidated assets and must meet certain other criteria such as limitations on the amount of off-balance sheet exposures and on trading assets and liabilities. The CBLR will be calculated by dividing tangible equity capital by average total consolidated assets. The final rule became effective on January 1, 2020. Although management believes that the Company and Bank would have qualified to utilize the CBLR framework on a pro forma basis as of December 31, 2019 had it been in effect on that date, no assurance can be given that they will continue to qualify as of any future date.

We may be required to write down goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets.
When we acquire a business, a portion of the purchase price of the acquisition may be allocated to goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired determines the amount of the purchase price that is allocated to goodwill acquired. At December 31, 2019, our goodwill totaled approximately $11.6 million, created in connection with the LyndonBank acquisition in 2007. Under current accounting standards, if we determine goodwill is impaired, we would be required to write down the value of these assets to fair value. We conduct a review each year, or more frequently if events or circumstances warrant such, to determine whether goodwill is impaired. We last completed a goodwill impairment analysis as of December 31, 2019, and concluded goodwill was not impaired. We cannot provide assurance that we will not be required to take an impairment charge in the future. Any impairment charge would have a negative effect on our shareholders’ equity and financial results and may cause a decline in our stock price.
We are not able to offer all of the financial services and products of a financial holding company.
Banks, securities firms, and insurance companies can now combine under a “financial holding company” umbrella. Financial holding companies can offer virtually any type of financial service, including banking, securities underwriting, insurance (both agency and underwriting), and merchant banking. Some of our competitors have elected to become financial holding companies. We offer only traditional banking products and, trust and investment management services indirectly through, our affiliate, CFSG.
